Timeline and TODO for the new zoom
==================================

1. Timeline
2. Todo

1. Timeline
===========

This is a very rough estimate and is very likely to change. It is based 
mostly on Google Summer of Code's important dates. Google Summer of Code
coding is scheduled to begin on 28th of May, but I expect to start work
on the skeleton prior to that, as it is not directly related to the GSoC
project. 

June 1st - A working skeleton of a zoom plugin   - Implemented as of May 19th
June 10th - Input enabled engine, no regressions from Beryl's inputzoom.c - Implemented as of May 19th
June 15th - Engine support for positioning the zoom - Partially implemented as of May 19th
June 25th - Cursor awareness
June 29th - Zoom follows cursor

July 9th - Mid term evaluation begins
July 15th - Follow focus
July 15th to 25th - Tune existing functionality.
July 30th - Fit window to zoom and fit zoom to window

August 1th to 20th - Polishing, testing, bug squashing and work on integration
                     with the community releases.

August 20th - Final evaluation begins

2. Todo
=======
This will be a working-list and will be added to and removed from during the
main development process (In other words; During the GSoC project's lifetime,
the summer of 2007).

  - Document the code structure
  - Initial engine design, specific functions.
  - Initial design for AT-SPI integration.
  - AT-SPI integration
  - Natural and generic way of handeling the cursor
  - Code to fit to a generic area
  - Code to fit zoom to a window
  - Code to fit a window to a specific zoom level
