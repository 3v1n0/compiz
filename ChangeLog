    Add VERSION file (0.9.5.0)

Sam Spilsbury <sam.spilsbury@canonical.com>	2011-05-26

    Don't write w->type () to w->wmType (). Instead back up the existing
    wmType and new wmType every time it changes and we apply the fix
    and then write that in when appropriate. Writing back w->type ()
    causes bugs in window matching.
    
    Fixes LP #765422

Sam Spilsbury <smspillaz@gmail.com>	2010-10-27

    Don't disable the ::handleCompizEvent function where there are windows
    still minimizing (since we still need a notification from them as to
    when they've finished animating)

Sam Spilsbury <smspillaz@gmail.com>	2010-10-26

    Don't unminimize transients when the window is being destroyed
    
    Unminimizing the transients means that we have to loop the window list
    in the ::~WorkaroundsWindow stage, and we don't know which of our windows
    have already been destroyed (which is problematic for ::get ()). Since
    the transients of windows are likely to be destroyed along with the main
    window and and also during the entire plugin tear-down phase we are unminimizing
    each individual window, there is no need to also unminimize transients for
    each window.
    
    FIXME: We should really implement a ::fini stage where we can guaruntee that
    nothing has been destroyed

    Added "keep thumbnails of minimized windows" option, as a WORKAROUND.
    
    This wraps ::minimize, ::unminimize and ::minimized in order to lie to plugins
    and also tell pagers etc that the window is gone.
    
    It also shapes out the input of the window, and does not paint the window, and
    on unminimize restores the shape of the window
