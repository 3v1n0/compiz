Notes on Graphics Drivers
=========================

Please amend this file as you discover undocumented behaviour in various
graphics drivers as it will assist other developers who may face similar
problems in future.

fglrx
=====

 1. fglrx is currently detecting the binary name "compiz" and forcing
    indirect mode rendering. This causes certain opengl functionality
    such as GLSL, framebuffer objects and vertex buffer objects to
    not work correctly even if they are advertised.

 RESOLVED. WORKAROUND: Distributions should change the binary name
 to something other than "compiz", either at ship time or execution time.

nvidia
======

 1. nvidia does not permit vertex array client states and vertex buffer
    objects to be active at the same time. Eg, the following code has
    undefined behaviour and will crash.

    glEnableClientState (GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
    ...
    glBindBufferARB (GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, vertexBuffer);
    glDrawArrays (GL_TRIANGLES, 0, vertexBufferSize);

 2. nvidia does not permit mixing of extension and core functionality
    tokens with extension entry points and core functionality entry
    points. The following is undefined:

    glBindFramebufferEXT (GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fboId);

mesa
====

 1. Mesa does not advertise GLX_BIND_TO_MIPMAP_TEXTURE_EXT even though
    mipmap storage for GLXPixmaps are supported.

 RESOLVED. WORKAROUND: Until this bug is fixed, detect when a Mesa driver
 is running and force the usage of GLX_BIND_TO_MIPMAP_TEXTURE on all
 24 and 32 bit depth fbconfigs

llvmpipe
========

 1. llvmpipe does not support using glXSwapBuffers and glXCopySubBufferMESA
    on the same front buffer

 RESOLVED. WORKAROUND: detect when llvmpipe is active and force the usage
 of glXSwapBuffers on every frame
