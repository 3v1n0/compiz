  [ Eleni Maria Stea ]
  * It fixes the 3d windows plugin. Problem: The 3d clipping is
    performed in viewing space (modelview transformation) and should be
    done inside the shader when we use shaders otherwise the viewing
    space pipeline operations will be ignored. Compiz used to perform
    the clipping inside the td plugin using pipeline functions, then it
    was loading a generic shader program (no clipping operations) to
    render the windows and then it rendered the 3d quads around the
    windows using the pipeline (so these were clipped correctly). (LP:
    #1395697)
  * Sometimes the MultipleCubes, Automatic or OneBigCube option might be
    set although we are not in multimonitor. Modified the 3d windows
    plugin to check the number of monitors as well.

  * New rebuild forced.

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Expo plugin: Make sure the Expo animation is completed before
    allowing clicks to be handled. (LP: #1026553)
  * Grid plugin: Float to int division truncating caused a 1 px gap on
    the right side of right semi-maximized window when the workspace has
    an odd width. Fix is to add 0.5 to the float division first to
    account for any truncation error. (LP: #1294864)

  [ Eleni Maria Stea ]
  * Change in GLVector implementation
  * Minor change: when the skydome was working (in the c version of
    compiz) it was rendered on top of the background so, there was no
    need to clear the screen before drawing (the skydome was rendered on
    top of the garbage from previous renderings, hiding it). In the c++
    plugin, the skydome is buggy and the background is visible (as well
    as some garbage from previous renderings). A temporary
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) was added until we fix the skydome and
    the other cube bugs.
  * glDisableOutputClipping was not implemented in 3d.cpp => a parent
    class glDisableOutputClipping was called, causing 2d clipping
    artifacts (the 3d cube was clipped and you couldn't see the windows
    move)

  [ Brandon Schaefer ]
  * Unrevert 3728, fix failing tests. Change the behaviour of
    undecorating windows. Previously when a window was undecorated, we
    would shift it back to an appropriate position according to its
    gravity member. That behaviour was problematic because in the
    StaticGravity case the window has to just stay in the same place.
    But then if you had a window with StaticGravity which then did get a
    decoration and later removed it, it would be placed as though it was
    decorated and appear to be in the wrong place. The correct behaviour
    is to place all windows as though they have decorations, and then
    when decorations are removed, to move the window back to the corner
    as indicated in its gravity and then expand its size to cover the
    obscured regions no longer hidden because the decorations went away.
    (LP: #1165343).   1. Completely remove decorOffsetMove and other
    related code from      decor.cpp. Put the logic to handle the
    window->input () - window->border ()      placement offset inside of
    setWindowFrameExtents instead. Now the window      will always be
    offset from its original non-decorated position to the new
         decorated position, rather than having to guess between
    decoration sizes.   2. Make saveGeometry and restoreGeometry work
    relative to window->border ()      as opposed to including it in the
    saved geometry. It is possible that the      border size might
    change during maximization, as such, we don't want to      save the
    position with the border before maximizing. Instead save the
    position      as if it were never decorated so that when the window
    is restored it can be      restored to its original position and
    then adjusted for its new border size.   3. Fix a few typoes in the
    tests.   4. Moved some commonly used matchers into compiz::testing
      5. Make COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR accept multiple directories and look in
    each one      of them for the plugin   6. Set COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR
    appropriately for each plugin that we wish to load      on startup
    so that we load locally built plugins as opposed to installed
         ones.   7. Uncomment compiz_discover_tests for the acceptance
    tests. Now they are      run by default. (LP: #1195522). (LP:
    #1195522, #1165343)
  * If we receive a stateNotifyChange, we check if we are in a max
    state. If so, overwrite the xwc with either X | W, or Y | H
    depending on the semi max state with the orig position before we
    went into a semi max state. This way when we leave any sort of max
    state the orig position is restored. If the window is being grabbed
    we do not overwrite the position, which it gets its own value at
    that point (instead of the orig pos). (LP: #892012)

  * Alt-Tabbing or Launcher selecting a window that is over 50% in a

  [ Sami Jaktholm ]
  * Expo plugin: 1) Always fetch the dndButton action in dndFini. The
    action given to dndFini might be a key or edge binding action if
    expo was terminated during window DnD. We shouldn't set their state
    to CompAction::StateInitButton or the bindings break. 2) Pass NULL
    action to termExpo if invoked from handleEvent Previously we passed
    the action of expoKey to termExpo which in turn passed it to
    dndFini. DndFini changed the action state to
    CompAction::StateInitButton that broke the keybinding. Now that
    dndFini fetches the dndButton action itself, there's no need to
    fetch it in handleEvent too as dndFini is the only one using the
    action. (LP: #1131106)
  * Expo: Cast denominators of integer divisions to floats before
    performing a matrix translation to viewports with the results.

  * Port dbus introspection to compiz 0.9. move xml creation to a
    separate class (IntrospectionResponse) for easier. memory management
    (allocate buffer and writer in ctor, free in dtor). move duplicated

    IntrospectionResponse and sends the resulting xml. Refactor
    handle*IntrospectMessage to work with compiz 0.9 interfaces. This
    also fixes the broken list method which was a result of logic error.
    The code to invoke list handler was never reached. This fixes most
    of the issues noted in bug 749084. (LP: #749084)
  * Bias the current viewport in addWindowSizeChanges. If window is
    visible in the current viewport, use that viewport when calculating
    geometries in addWindowSizeChanges. Otherwise the current method is
    used. This way visible windows are maximized in the current
    viewport. However, offscreen windows won't jump back to the active
    viewport if window maximizes by itself or addWindowSizeChanges is
    called for some other reason. (LP: #776435)

  * Decor: Use maximized border extents only if window is fully
    maximized. The decorator draws a normal border around semi-maximized
    windows. When maximized border extents were used for semi-maximized
    windows, compiz didn't reserve any space for the border in its
    geometry calculations. At least following problems are a result of
    this behavior: Semi-maximized windows have 1px borders drawn on
    adjacent workspaces. (LP: #986051). Grid placed window overlaps the
    adjacent viewport (LP: #898870). (LP: #986051, #898870)

    (type) instead of (type) cast. Added and removed newlines if
    appropriate. Fixed indentation. Added TODOs. Expo, speed
    improvements: Do not calculate screen->vpSize ().width () and
    screen->vpSize ().height () multiple times, instead save them in the
    unsigned ints vpCountHorz and vpCountVert and use those variables
    instead. Speed up the curve calculations by using additional
    variables to save results to not have to re-calculate those all the
    time. The new variables introduced are degToRad, screenWidth,
    screenWidthSquared, curveDistSquaredPlusQuarter,
    pOne2MinusCurveDist, v0Squared and v2Squared. Also introduced const
    float halfGapX = gapX / 2.0 and used this variable in the
    calculations of curveDistance and curveRadius. Simplified
    calculations of this type: (M_PI / 180.0f) * curveAngle / 2.0, which
    is equal to: (M_PI / 360.0f) * curveAngle Do not call
    optionGetGroundSize (); twice, instead save the value in the float
    groundSize and use that variable in the following calculations.
    Removed the creation of the redundant bool hide, which is just used
    once in an if-condition check. It does not help to have this bool.
    Try to avoid redundant GL_BLEND state changes, they are expensive -
    only enable GL_BLEND if it is disabled and just disable it, if it
    was disabled before, otherwise do nothing. Try to avoid redundant GL
    filter changes - just query the filter state if the mipmap option in
    CCSM is enabled. Also just set back the filter to the previous state
    if we actually changed it, otherwise do nothing. -5.5f * 2 = -11.0f.
    No need to calculate M_PI / 180.0f 720 times: Calculate this value
    once instead and save it in the const float mpi, use mpi in the
    following looped calculations. Use const int scw in the same loop
    instead of calling screen->width () 360 times. glow.cpp: Massively
    increased calculation speed of the glow texture: No need for any
    macros here -> removed them and replaced them with local variables.
    Precalculate values, store them in local variables and use those in
    the following calculations (new variables are the ints winRealX,
    winRealY, winRealWidth, winRealHeight, halfWinRealWidth,
    halfWinRealHeight, xPlusHalfWidth, yPlusHalfHeight, xPlusGlowOff,
    yPlusGlowOff, xMinusGlowOff, yMinusGlowOff and the float glowPart).
    Used w->geometry ().widthIncBorders () and w->geometry
    ().heightIncBorders () to determine winRealWidth and winRealHeight.
    Expo, fixes: Do not force "One wall per output" on the user, if his
    displays use different resolutions. "One big wall" makes a lot of
    sense for many multi-screen configs, where not all of the screens
    have exactly the same resolution, so if the user explicitely chooses
    this mode, Compiz should respect the user's choice. (LP: #1009592).

    plugins/freewins/COPYING - we do not need another copy of the GPL v2
    here. Removed another copy of the GPL v2 from plugins/workarounds.
    This will reduce package sizes, download time and bring some order
    to chaos.
  * Expo, .xml.in fixes: Better description of the plugin. Improved and
    fixed tooltips. Moved the "Curve Strength" option closer to
    "Deformation". Refreshed the quilt patch for Ubuntu: There is no
    need to set the default distance to 0.005 as this setting has no
    effect without deformation. Set default multi-screen mode to "One
    wall per output" for Ubuntu, because "One big wall" works now for
    all display configurations and could potentially change the
    appearance for Ubuntu users. (LP: #1074487). (LP: #1074487)
  * Added contribute directory. Added QtCreatorConfig.xml, a
    configuration file for Qt Creator, which adjusts Qt Creator's C++
    indentation style to be the same that is used in the Compiz project
    (X11, mixed spaces and tabs).
  * Mousepoll: Fixed mousepoll version mismatch. (COMPIZ_MOUSEPOLL_ABI
    was missing) (LP: #1195659). (LP: #1195659)
  * Expo: Simplified the GL filter handling.
  * Fixed broken text in all plugins (missing COMPIZ_TEXT_ABI). (LP:
    #1196493). (LP: #1196493)
  * CCSM: Fixed vertical alignment of the text on the stylized keys.
    (Shift, Super, Ctrl, Alt) (LP: #1196345). (LP: #1196345)
  * Thumbnail, cleanup: Merged if condition checks. Declaration of
    variables when they are needed (C++ style). Removed redundant
    brackets. Removed useless "/* Could someone please explain how this
    works */" comment. Removed extern const unsigned short
    TEXT_DISTANCE, because this variable does not exist anymore (value
    is configurable already). Changed if (something > 0.0) to if
    (something), 10 times. Changed pointedWin = 0; to pointedWin =
    NULL;. Used centerX () and centerY () abstractions from
    compiz::window::Geometry to determine the icon center coordinates.
    Added and removed newlines, if appropriate. Fixed indentation.
    Thumbnail, code speedup: Return ASAP, do not calculate stuff you
    might not need. No need for WIN_W (w) and WIN_H (w) macros, removed
    those and replaced them with the local variables int winWidth, int
    winHeight, int dockWidth and int dockHeight. No need for WIN_X (w)
    and WIN_Y (w) macros, replaced those with int dockX and int dockY.
    Introduced int tHeight = thumb.height;, int tWidth = thumb.width;,
    int halfTWidth = tWidth / 2; and int halfTHeight = tHeight / 2; and
    used those variables in the following calculations. Use
    igMidPoint[0] and igMidPoint[1] as arguments in the screen-
    >outputDeviceForPoint (arg1, arg2) function, instead of re-
    calculating the arguments again. Thumbnail, GL speedup: Introduced
    GLfloat wxPlusWidth = wx + width;, GLfloat wyPlusHeight = wy +
    height;, GLfloat wxPlusWPlusOff = wxPlusWidth + off;, GLfloat
    wyPlusHPlusOff = wyPlusHeight + off;, GLfloat wxMinusOff = wx - off;
    and GLfloat wyMinusOff = wy - off; and used those coordinates in the
    vertexData arrays. No need to re- calculate those values multiple
    times. Just query optionGetShowDelay () once and use int showDelay
    later. We just enable blending if it is currently disabled and
    disable blending only, if it was disabled before.
  * src/session.cpp cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. (this *should* fix bug #1101405) Use pre-
    instead of postfix increments. Added and removed newlines. Added
    missing break (just a style issue). Fixed indentation. (LP:
    #1101405). (LP: #1101405)
  * Firepaint, code cleanup: Declare variables outside of loops.
    Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line. Use pre-
    instead of postfix increment. Removed redundant newlines. Removed
    redundant casts. (from (float) optionGetFireColor) Removed redundant
    brackets. Added missing break (style issue only). Added comment and
    TODO. Fixed indentation. Firepaint, speedup: We just enable GL_BLEND
    if it is disabled and we just disable GL_BLEND if it was disabled
    before. Introduced the GLfloats xMinusW, xPlusW, yMinusH and yPlusH
    to store calculated coordinates instead of recalculating them
    multiple times. Introduced float fireLife = optionGetFireLife ();,
    float fireWidth = optionGetFireSize ();, float fireHeight =
    fireWidth * 1.5f; and bool mystFire = optionGetFireMystical (); and
    used those variables inside the loop. Firepaint, .xml.in cleanup:
    Firepaint now has 2 tabs, 'General' and 'Particle Settings'. The
    name of this plugin is Firepaint, <short> should not contain the
    description. Better description of the plugin. Uppercase option
    titles. Punctuation for tooltips. Improved tooltips. Firepaint,
    fixes: Initialize all class member variables in the ParticleSystem::
    ParticleSystem () ctor (LP: #1101512, LP: #1101580). (LP: #1101512,
    #1101580)
  * img* plugins code cleanup: Always bail out of function ASAP, do not
    calculate stuff you might not need. Declare variables outside of
    loops so they won't be re-declared in each loop. Use prefix instead
    of postfix increments. Declaration and assignment of variables in
    one line. Merged if condition checks. Added and removed brackets.
    Added and removed newlines, if appropriate. Minor code structure
    improvements, declare variables when you need them, not much
    earlier. Fixed indentation.
  * Text, speed improvements: Introduced const float halfPi = PI / 2.0f;
    and const float triHalfPi = halfPi * 3; and used those to draw the
    rounded background. Introduced GLfloat xPlusWidth = x + width; and
    GLfloat yMinusHeight = y - height; and used those coordinates for
    the vertexData array. Text, cleanup: Declaration of local variables
    outside of loops. Fixed indentation.
  * cube.cpp, code cleanup: #include "privates.h", not <privates.h>.
    Merged if condition checks. Declaration of variables, where you need
    them to improve the code structure and readability. Use C++ standard
    bool for topDir, bottomDir, allCaps and mCapsPainted[output] (bool
    true/false instead Bool TRUE/FALSE). Initialize all of the class
    member variables in the constructor. Replaced if (priv->mSky.size ()
    > 0) with if (!priv->mSky.empty ()). Removed redundant brackets.
    Fixed indentation. Added TODO. cube.cpp, code speedup: Do not call
    optionGetInactiveOpacity () twice, instead save the value as float
    inactiveOpacity and use this variable in the following calculation.
    Introduced the variables float halfHsize = hsize / 2.0; and float
    tsSize = 360.0f / size; and used those in following calculations to
    not have to recalculate those values multiple times. Do not
    calculate M_PI / sides and 2 * M_PI / sides multiple times in loops,
    instead save those values in the GLfloats mps and tmps and use those
    values inside the loops. Use GLdouble mDist2 = 0.5 / mDistance; in
    the GLdouble clipPlane* arrays, instead of recalculating this value
    multiple times. Use GLfloat oneMinusFStepX = 1.0f - fStepX; and
    GLfloat oneMinusFStepY = 1.0f - fStepY; instead of calculating those
    values multiple times. Use float outputWidth = outputPtr->width ();
    and float outputHeight = outputPtr->height (); instead of calling
    the functions multiple times. Introduced the GLfloat normInvert =
    0.5f * invert; and used this variable instead of recalculating this
    value multiple times. Introduced the GLfloats mSkyWidth and
    mSkyHeight and used those in the following loops instead of calling
    mSkySize.width () and mSkySize.height () multiple times. Try to
    avoid redundant GL_BLEND state changes, because OpenGL will blindly
    change the global state, no matter what it currently is set to and
    that state change is expensive. So we query and save the actual
    blending state in the variable GLboolean glBlendEnabled =
    glIsEnabled (GL_BLEND); and just enable it if it isn't already and
    just disable it, if it was disabled before. (LP: #1101422, LP:
    #1195977) cube.cpp, other fixes: Return false in function
    PrivateCubeScreen::updateGeometry (int, int) if sides should ever be
    0, which should never happen, but should make Coverity happy. (LP:
    #1101541) Initialize all class member variables in the
    PrivateCubeScreen:: PrivateCubeScreen (CompScreen *) constructor.
    (mTc, mNOutput, mOutput, mOutputMask, mCleared, mCapsPainted) (LP:
    #1101575). (LP: #1195977, #1101541, #1101422, #1101575)
  * plugins/ezoom/src/ezoom.cpp: Also initialize xtrans and ytrans in
    the ctors. Just just enable blending if it is disabled and just
    disable it if it was disabled before. Introduced the variables
    oWidth, oHeight, halfOWidth and halfOHeight to speed up following
    calculations. Return ASAP, do not calculate possibly redundant
    stuff. Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line.
    Improved readability. Added and removed newlines. Minor indentation
    fixes. plugins/ezoom/ezoom.xml.in: Removed redundant whitespaces
    from a tooltip. (LP: #1101572). (LP: #1101572)
  * gears.cpp, gears.h: Do not render the gears if we are viewing the
    cube from the inside - the gears are otherwise obstructing the
    users' view on his workspaces. Print a warning to the console once
    in this case. (LP: #1185819). (LP: #1185819)
  * Animation code cleanup: Return ASAP, do not calculate stuff you
    might not need. Declare CompWindow *w, AnimWindow *animWin,
    PrivateAnimWindow *aw and Animation *curAnim outside the for loop.
    grid.cpp: Declare float x, y, topiyFloat outside the for loop.
    options.cpp: Declare unsigned int nOptions outside the foreach loop.
    Use pre- instead of postfix de- and increments. Declaration and
    assignment of variables in one line. Merged if condition checks.
    Added and removed brackets. Added and removed newlines. Fixed
    indentation. Also initialize the non-static class members
    "mGridWidth" and "mGridHeight" in the GridAnim::GridAnim ctor. (LP:
    #1101618). (LP: #1101618)

  * Satisfy matchers on getProperty as soon as they are set. The order
    of evaluation for matchers in Google Mock appears to be undefined -
    this means that we can't rely on the first argument being matched
    first and the second argument being matched afterwards. In turn,
    this means that any GValue may be passed to a GValueMatch which, by
    a design flaw, is unable to handle any values of a type it does not
    expect (at least not without an API change). It will silently pass
    the incorrect type to g_type_get_* which causes internal assertion
    failures. At the moment we're just interleaving the calls to
    getProperty and get_property - that way the expectations are
    satisfied and go away as soon as they're set. This in turn means
    that Google Mock only has to traverse one matcher rather than
    multiple matchers. (LP: #1187468). (LP: #1187468)
  * Extends invisible borders to the title bar too. (LP: #717444). (LP:
    #717444)
  * Disable grid/put_maximize_key on ubuntu.
  * Port to new gmock. Disable some faling tests because of weird leaks.
    (LP: #1185265)
  * Update window geo only on new decoration size only if mapped. (LP:
    #1198000). (LP: #1198000)
  * Disable show_desktop_key by default on ubuntu. Will provide the same
    option under the unityshell panel. (LP: #1204664)
  * Use Glib::RefPtr<Glib::Source> in glib_integration_test. After the
    fix of bug https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=561885
    Glib::Source::~Source is called when both Source::unreference() and
    SourceCallbackData::destroy_notify_callback() are called. (LP:
    #1214459)
  * Terminate scale on mouse click on an empty area. (LP: #1234624)

  [ Sam Spilsbury ]
  * Change the behaviour of undecorating windows. Previously when a
    window was undecorated, we would shift it back to an appropriate
    position according to its gravity member. That behaviour was
    problematic because in the StaticGravity case the window has to just
    stay in the same place. But then if you had a window with
    StaticGravity which then did get a decoration and later removed it,
    it would be placed as though it was decorated and appear to be in
    the wrong place. The correct behaviour is to place all windows as
    though they have decorations, and then when decorations are removed,
    to move the window back to the corner as indicated in its gravity
    and then expand its size to cover the obscured regions no longer
    hidden because the decorations went away. (LP: #1165343). (LP:
    #1165343)
  * Added some new hooks to PluginClassHandler to allow a VTable to
    specify if loaded. PluginClassHandler::get () was designed to simply
    instantiate an instance of that class for the core structure, but it
    did this without checking if the plugin was loaded. Added some new
    methods to PluginClassHandler exposed by LoadedPluginClassBridge and
    only accessible by those who implement PluginKey to specify globally
    whether or not a plugin is actually loaded, so that
    PluginClassHandler can return accordingly. Integration and unit
    tests added as appropriate (LP: #1169620) (LP: #1101026). (LP:
    #1101026, #1169620)
  * Satisfy matchers on getProperty as soon as they are set. The order
    of evaluation for matchers in Google Mock appears to be undefined -
    this means that we can't rely on the first argument being matched
    first and the second argument being matched afterwards. In turn,
    this means that any GValue may be passed to a GValueMatch which, by
    a design flaw, is unable to handle any values of a type it does not
    expect (at least not without an API change). It will silently pass
    the incorrect type to g_type_get_* which causes internal assertion
    failures. At the moment we're just interleaving the calls to
    getProperty and get_property - that way the expectations are
    satisfied and go away as soon as they're set. This in turn means
    that Google Mock only has to traverse one matcher rather than
    multiple matchers. (LP: #1187468). (LP: #1187468)
  * Revert revision 3278.
  * Immediately update the window matrices and regions if the number of
    textures changed. (LP: #1189369). (LP: #1189369)
  * Provide a basic decor plugin acceptance test suite. This change
    provides a simple acceptance test suite for the decor plugin. It
    creates a fake window decorator (cdt::FakeDecorator) and allows
    users to create fake decorations (eg cdt::FakePixmapDecoration)
    which can be serialized as decoration properties and set on windows
    under xorg-gtest. It also launches compiz with the opengl, composite
    and decor plugins loaded and runs some basic tests. Among them:
    BaseDecorAcceptance. Startup: Basic canary "can we start compiz with
    these plugins" test
    FakeDecoratorSessionOwnerNameSetOnSelectionOwner: Create a fake
    decorator, ensure that libdecoration sets our session name "fake" on
    the selection owner FakeDecoratorReceiveClientMessage: Create fake
    decorator, ensure that libdecoration posts a client message to the
    root window announcing that the new decorator exists.
    DecorationSupportsWindowType: Create a fake decorator, announce
    support for the WINDOW type decorations and ensure that the correct
    atom is set on the session owner window.
    DecorationSupportsPixmapType: Create a fake decorator, announce
    support for the PIXMAP type decorations and ensure that the correct
    atom is set on the session owner window.
    DecorFakeDecoratorAcceptance. WindowDefaultFallbackNoExtents: By
    default, newly created windows should recieve a fallback decoration
    but they should not have any frame extents.
    DecorWithPixmapDefaultsAcceptance. These tests create a default
    pixmap decoration to use in the hypothetical situation that the
    window decorator hasn't yet generated a decoration for this window.
    FallbackRecieveInputFrameNotify: Verify that we get a
    _COMPIZ_WINDOW_DECOR_INPUT_FRAME property set on the client when it
    is created and mapped (eg, an input frame window was annonuced to be
    created) FallbackHasInputFrameInParent: Verify that a second window
    exists in the frame window after this message was recieved.
    FallbackNormalWindowExtentOnDecoration: Verify that
    _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS is set to the default window extents for the
    default decoration when the window was mapped.
    FallbackNormalWindowInputOnFrame: Verify that the input window
    matches the extents set. PixmapDecoratedWindowAcceptance. These
    tests create a new window and an associated unique decoration for
    that window. MaximizeBorderExtentsOnMaximize: Maximize the window
    and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeBorderExtentsOnVertMaximize: Vertically maximize the window
    and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeBorderExtentsOnHorzMaximize: Horizontally maximize the
    window and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputSize: Maximie the window and ensure
    that the frame window exactly equals the output size.
    VertMaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputYHeight: Maximize the window and
    ensure that the frame window's Y and Height values are consistent
    with the output size. HorzMaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputXWidth:
    Ditto horizontal maximization.
    DISABLED_VertMaximizeFrameWindowSizeSameXWidth: Maximize the window
    vertically and ensure that the frame window's border-relative X
    position and width does not change. This test is disabled, as the
    behavior in compiz is currently broken, (but it means that we can
    fix it later and enable the test).
    DISABLED_HorzMaximizeFrameWindowSizeSameYHeight Maximize the window
    horizontally and ensure that the frame window's border-relative Y
    position and height does not change. This test is disabled, as the
    behavior in compiz is currently broken, (but it means that we can
    fix it later and enable the test). (LP: #1188900). (LP: #1188900)
  * Only mark for no further instantiations once we've finished
    destructing the plugin (LP: #1193596). (LP: #1193596)
  * Add more acceptance tests for the decor plugin.
    PixmapDecoratedWindowAcceptance. UndecoratedWindowExpandToOrigSize
    Test that upon undecoration, the window has exactly the same
    geometry as it did before decoration.
    DISABLED_UndecorateStaticGravityWindow Tests that for windows with a
    static gravity, the window has exactly the same geometry as it did
    before decoration. Disabled, as core is currently not moving the
    window with the static gravity back to where it started.
    AdjustmentExtents/PixmapDecorationAdjustment.
    AdjustRestoredWindowBorderMovesClient/P Test that changing the
    border extents causes the client window's absolute geometry to
    change. DISABLED_AdjustRestoredWindowBorderShrinkClient/P Tests that
    changing the border extents causes the client window's absolute
    geometry to shrink by the amount of border. Disabled, as the current
    behavior is to expand the frame window as opposed to shrinking the
    client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinks/P Tests that as the border
    shrinks away, the client expands back to its original size.
    Disabled, as the current behavior is to expand the frame window as
    opposed to shrinking the client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinksWhilstMaximized/P Tests that
    even if the client is maximized, if the restored border shrinks away
    it demaximizes back to the same position while also accounting for
    any change in the restored window border size. Disabled, as the
    current behavior is to expand the frame window as opposed to
    shrinking the client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinksWhilstUndecorated/P Tests that
    even when the client is not permitted to be decorated because the
    decoration hint was removed, when it is redecorated it will be moved
    to the correct position taking into account any changes in its
    border size. Disabled, as the current behavior is to expand the
    frame window as opposed to shrinking the client (but this will be
    changed). DISABLED_AdjustRestoredWindowInputNoMoveClient/P Tests
    that adjusting the input extents (as independent from the border
    extents) of the client does not cause the client to move. Disabled,
    as this behavior appears to be broken in core. Move the
    "GetImmediateParent" function into the compiz::testing namespace so
    that it can be used by other tests. (LP: #1188900)
  * Unrevert 3728, fix failing tests. Change the behaviour of
    undecorating windows. Previously when a window was undecorated, we
    would shift it back to an appropriate position according to its
    gravity member. That behaviour was problematic because in the
    StaticGravity case the window has to just stay in the same place.
    But then if you had a window with StaticGravity which then did get a
    decoration and later removed it, it would be placed as though it was
    decorated and appear to be in the wrong place. The correct behaviour
    is to place all windows as though they have decorations, and then
    when decorations are removed, to move the window back to the corner
    as indicated in its gravity and then expand its size to cover the
    obscured regions no longer hidden because the decorations went away.
    (LP: #1165343).   1. Completely remove decorOffsetMove and other
    related code from      decor.cpp. Put the logic to handle the
    window->input () - window->border ()      placement offset inside of
    setWindowFrameExtents instead. Now the window      will always be
    offset from its original non-decorated position to the new
         decorated position, rather than having to guess between
    decoration sizes.   2. Make saveGeometry and restoreGeometry work
    relative to window->border ()      as opposed to including it in the
    saved geometry. It is possible that the      border size might
    change during maximization, as such, we don't want to      save the
    position with the border before maximizing. Instead save the
    position      as if it were never decorated so that when the window
    is restored it can be      restored to its original position and
    then adjusted for its new border size.   3. Fix a few typoes in the
    tests.   4. Moved some commonly used matchers into compiz::testing
      5. Make COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR accept multiple directories and look in
    each one      of them for the plugin   6. Set COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR
    appropriately for each plugin that we wish to load      on startup
    so that we load locally built plugins as opposed to installed
         ones.   7. Uncomment compiz_discover_tests for the acceptance
    tests. Now they are      run by default. (LP: #1195522). (LP:
    #1195522, #1165343)
  * Add a simple script for making releases.
  * Port to new gmock. Disable some faling tests because of weird leaks.
    (LP: #1185265)
  * Don't add the frame to the toplevel stack if it hasn't been created
    yet. In the event that a window is unreparented or destroyed, we
    usually need to add its frame window to the toplevel window stack
    until the time at which we recieve a DestroyNotify for it, as there
    may be incoming ConfigureNotify events puporting to stack other
    windows relative to that frame. However, this does not apply in the
    case where we have not yet received a CreateNotify for the frame
    window. In that case, it is not possible for any stacking requests
    to be made relative to this window, so it does not need to be added
    immediately. Instead, we can add it at the time that we recieve a
    CreateNotify for it as a regular override redirect window until the
    time that it is later destroyed. (LP: #1171314). (LP: #1171314)
  * Remove redundant src/logmessage/include/core/logmessage.h (LP:
    #1067246). (LP: #1067246)
  * Adjust acceptance tests for the fix to LP: #1198000 1. Always set
    frame extents before updating the frame 2. Added
    COMPIZ_NO_CONFIGURE_BUFFER_LOCKS so that we don't have to deal with
    the delayed configure requests logic in the tests where it does not
    help 3. Split restoredDecorationSize in to
    restoredDecorationBorderSize and restoredDecorationInputSize so that
    we can measure the size of the decoration both in terms of its
    visible and invisible border 4. Wait for the default decoration
    properly 5. Capture the initial geometry of the window with and
    without decorations when the window gets its first decoration. Use
    these values to calculate the size changes in the window from then
    on instead of its creation values 6. Just flag when the window was
    first decorated in setWindowFrameExtents rather than checking if it
    is mapped. We only want to not resize the window once. (LP:
    #1198000)
  * Release version 0.9.10.0
  * Bump VERSION to 0.9.10.2
  * Ensure that the frame region is always set as soon as the window is
    decorated. Further ensure that the window decoration isn't
    needlessly reset if the window already had one. Refactored XShape
    usage into a common function. Added tests to verify the behaviour of
    shape set on initially creating a decorated window and also upon
    changing the input frame window shape (LP: #1158267). (LP: #1158267)
  * Add support for the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on hardware that
    supports it, which should result in a nice speed-boost due to the
    fact that we no longer have to abuse fillrate by retaining old frame
    contents, and instead asking the driver how defined the current
    frame is. (LP: #1024304)

  * Work done by Sam Spilsbury: - Ensure that the frame region is always
    set as soon as the window is decorated. - Further ensure that the
    window decoration isn't needlessly reset if the window already had
    one. - Refactored XShape usage into a common function. - Added tests
    to verify the behaviour of shape set on initially creating a
    decorated window and also upon changing the input frame window
    shape. (LP: #1158267)
  * Alt-Tabbing or Launcher selecting a window that is over 50% in a
    different viewport should not switch the viewport nor change the
    placement of the window. The fix is to add an option to turn this
    behavior on or off. By default, the option is on, but Ubuntu is
    patched to turn it off to fix this bug. (LP: #1092323)

  * Fix for bug #763148 (with added test cases): when the desktop is

    #763148)

  [ Brandon Schaefer ]
  * Unrevert 3728, fix failing tests. Change the behaviour of
    undecorating windows. Previously when a window was undecorated, we
    would shift it back to an appropriate position according to its
    gravity member. That behaviour was problematic because in the
    StaticGravity case the window has to just stay in the same place.
    But then if you had a window with StaticGravity which then did get a
    decoration and later removed it, it would be placed as though it was
    decorated and appear to be in the wrong place. The correct behaviour
    is to place all windows as though they have decorations, and then
    when decorations are removed, to move the window back to the corner
    as indicated in its gravity and then expand its size to cover the
    obscured regions no longer hidden because the decorations went away.
    (LP: #1165343).   1. Completely remove decorOffsetMove and other
    related code from      decor.cpp. Put the logic to handle the
    window->input () - window->border ()      placement offset inside of
    setWindowFrameExtents instead. Now the window      will always be
    offset from its original non-decorated position to the new
         decorated position, rather than having to guess between
    decoration sizes.   2. Make saveGeometry and restoreGeometry work
    relative to window->border ()      as opposed to including it in the
    saved geometry. It is possible that the      border size might
    change during maximization, as such, we don't want to      save the
    position with the border before maximizing. Instead save the
    position      as if it were never decorated so that when the window
    is restored it can be      restored to its original position and
    then adjusted for its new border size.   3. Fix a few typoes in the
    tests.   4. Moved some commonly used matchers into compiz::testing
      5. Make COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR accept multiple directories and look in
    each one      of them for the plugin   6. Set COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR
    appropriately for each plugin that we wish to load      on startup
    so that we load locally built plugins as opposed to installed
         ones.   7. Uncomment compiz_discover_tests for the acceptance
    tests. Now they are      run by default. (LP: #1195522). (LP:
    #1195522, #1165343)
  * If we receive a stateNotifyChange, we check if we are in a max
    state. If so, overwrite the xwc with either X | W, or Y | H
    depending on the semi max state with the orig position before we
    went into a semi max state. This way when we leave any sort of max
    state the orig position is restored. If the window is being grabbed
    we do not overwrite the position, which it gets its own value at
    that point (instead of the orig pos). (LP: #892012)

  * *Grid code: Prevent center and corner gridded windows from jumping
    viewports. (Thanks and credits for this go to Sami Jaktholm) Prevent
    top and bottom gridded windows from jumping viewports by making
    those semi-maximize horizontally. As those are actually semi-
    maximized horizontally, we will treat them as such and let core
    handle the restoring, just like we already do for vertically semi-
    maximized grid windows (left/right). Now "Strg+Super+Down" will
    restore top and bottom gridded windows correctly as well. Also
    multiple gridding to top, bottom, left or right will not overwrite
    the stored original size anymore. Restore windows also when
    workspace switcher (expo) is active. (Thanks and credits for this go
    to Sami Jaktholm) Allow cycling for all gridded windows if
    explicitly specified by the user in CCSM. Forbid cycling through
    different sizes for corner and center-gridded windows also per
    default, now fully fixing bug #878820 and following the design
    specification by Ayatana Design there, making behaviour consistent.
    Introduced 3 new bools: horzMaximizedGridPosition,
    vertMaximizedGridPosition, anyMaximizedGridPosition Used these bools
    inside the if condition checks. Simplified complicated if condition
    by removing redundant additional size check. Cleanup all around.
    *Grid xml: Added cycle_sizes bool option, which allows the user to
    choose the prefered behaviour (fixed versus flexible sizes on
    multiple presses on the same grid keyboard shortcut). Default of
    this option is off, cycling disabled as specified by design. Added
    punctuation where missing and removed it where usually is none.
    Fixed typos, improved description and titles. *Expo code: Tell grid
    when viewport change is in progress. (Thanks and credits for this go

    and COMPIZ_OPENGL_ABI instead of CORE_ABIVERSION. (LP: #1181461)
  * Fade: Fix a typo that causes fade to constantly damage windows with
    a modified saturation. (LP: #1159054)
  * Grid: Fix window misplacement if a window is restored but the size
    doesn't change. - Set isGridResized to false before configuring the
    window in GridScreen::restoreWindow. If the restored geometry is the
    same as current geometry, configureXWindow will trigger moveNotify
    instead of resizeNotify. As isGridResized is still true,
    GridWindow::moveNotify blocks the restoration movement and the
    pointer detaches from the decoration. - Don't use pointerBufs when
    calculating position of the restored window with snapback windows
    disabled. The window will be positioned a bit too high (or low) and
    the pointer detaches from decoration if the movement was actually
    tracked. This was a workaround for the first point and can be safely
    removed. (LP: #1115344)
  * Fix memory leaks in titleinfo plugin. (LP: #1101569, #1101454)
  * Expo plugin: 1) Always fetch the dndButton action in dndFini. The
    action given to dndFini might be a key or edge binding action if
    expo was terminated during window DnD. We shouldn't set their state
    to CompAction::StateInitButton or the bindings break. 2) Pass NULL
    action to termExpo if invoked from handleEvent Previously we passed
    the action of expoKey to termExpo which in turn passed it to
    dndFini. DndFini changed the action state to
    CompAction::StateInitButton that broke the keybinding. Now that
    dndFini fetches the dndButton action itself, there's no need to
    fetch it in handleEvent too as dndFini is the only one using the
    action. (LP: #1131106)
  * Expo: Cast denominators of integer divisions to floats before
    performing a matrix translation to viewports with the results.
    Otherwise rounding errors in cases the results are not an integers
    cause the viewports to be painted offscreen. (LP: #438580)
  * Port dbus introspection to compiz 0.9. - move xml creation to a
    separate class (IntrospectionResponse) for easier memory management
    (allocate buffer and writer in ctor, free in dtor). - move
    duplicated response sending code to a separate method that takes
    IntrospectionResponse and sends the resulting xml. - Refactor
    handle*IntrospectMessage to work with compiz 0.9 interfaces. This
    also fixes the broken list method which was a result of logic error.
    The code to invoke list handler was never reached. This fixes most
    of the issues noted in bug 749084. (LP: #749084)
  * Bias the current viewport in addWindowSizeChanges. If window is
    visible in the current viewport, use that viewport when calculating
    geometries in addWindowSizeChanges. Otherwise the current method is
    used. This way visible windows are maximized in the current
    viewport. However, offscreen windows won't jump back to the active
    viewport if window maximizes by itself or addWindowSizeChanges is
    called for some other reason. (LP: #776435)
  * Expo: Recompute glow quads if a desktop window is resized. (LP:
    #1090713). (LP: #1090713)
  * Decor: Use maximized border extents only if window is fully
    maximized. The decorator draws a normal border around semi-maximized
    windows. When maximized border extents were used for semi-maximized
    windows, compiz didn't reserve any space for the border in its
    geometry calculations. At least following problems are a result of
    this behavior: - Semi-maximized windows have 1px borders drawn on
    adjacent workspaces (LP: #986051). - Grid placed window overlaps the
    adjacent viewport (LP: #898870). (LP: #986051, #898870)

  * Adding a uniform to a GLVertexBuffer that uses AutoProgram causes
    compiz to segfault. Example: gWindow->addShaders("cms", "",
    fragment_shader); gWindow->vertexBuffer()->addUniform("cms_lut",
    unit); // segfault happens later in PrivateVertexBuffer::render The
    patch modifies PrivateVertexBuffer::render to set the uniform on the
    generated AutoProgram instead of the provided program, which in this
    case is NULL, causing a segfault. (LP: #1162598). (LP: #1162598)

  * Cube-addon (Cube Reflection and Deformation): If the user disables
    "Draw top face"/"Draw bottom face" we do not want to draw anything
    (LP: #1162484). The original, non-deformed caps will only work for
    the non-deformed cube, so we can just use the original function in
    that case. We need to clear the texture if no texture files are
    specified in "Image files", otherwise the old texture would still be
    drawn, even if all image files are removed (LP: #1162711). Now we
    will default back and use the cube cap colors and opacities defined
    in the "Desktop Cube" plugin (if "Draw top/bottom face" are enabled
    only, see above). This way the user can choose between (for
    top/bottom): 1. Do not draw a cube cap face at all ("Draw top/bottom
    face" option disabled) 2. Use color and opacity specified in
    "Desktop Cube" (empty images list) 3. Use a texture for the cap
    (image is in the list, which is default) Removed redundant mCurrent
    = mCurrent % mFiles.size (); calculation, this has already been
    done: cap->mCurrent = (cap->mCurrent + change + count) % count;
    count and change both need to be != 0 for mCurrent to change. Fixed

    and assignment of local variables in one line, if possible, minor

    cleanup: Minor cleanup in the rendering code. Removed redundant
    #ifndef USE_GLES compiler option, GLES can cope with enabling and
    disabling GL_BLEND. Use prefix- instead of postfix increments.
    Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line. Reduced
    the scope of the variables x1, y1, x2 and y2. Replaced magic number
    65535.0f with const float MaxUShortFloat = std::numeric_limits
    <unsigned short>::max ();. Indentation fixes. C++ style for
    comments, added comments. (LP: #1169353, LP: #1172234). (LP:
    #1169353, #1172234)
  * Shift Switcher code cleanup: Use prefix instead of postfix increment
    and decrement. Declaration and assignment of local variables in one
    line. Merged if statements. Added brackets to for loops. Fixed
    indentation. Added and removed newlines for better readability.
    Added comment.
  * Cube Addon .xml cleanup: Better plugin description. Uppercase
    titles. Improved tooltips and names.
  * Animation code cleanup: Use prefix- instead of postfix- in- and
    decrements. Removed redundant brackets. Added and removed newlines
    where appropriate. Fixed indentation.
  * Grid, code cleanup: Merged if statements. Replaced magic number
    65535.0f with const float MaxUShortFloat = std::numeric_limits
    <unsigned short>::max ();. Use prefix- instead of postfix-increment.
    Removed redundant (float) casts. Removed redundant brackets. Added
    and removed newlines to improve readability. Minor indentation
    fixes.
  * Workspacenames .xml cleanup: Better description of the plugin's
    functionality. Improved tooltips.
  * Cube .xml cleanup: Better plugin description. Uppercase titles.
    Improved tooltips.
  * Shift Switcher .xml cleanup: Better description of the plugin's
    function. Fixed load before "bs" plugin typo -> it is the obs
    plugin. Created a "Switcher Mode" tab and moved Flip/Cover mode
    settings there. Created a subgroup for mouse-specific settings.
    Better tooltips with enhanced descriptions. Improved titles. Fixes
    all around (typos, etc.).
  * Refactor screenshot code to make it clearer and also to allow us to
    take screenshots in glPaintOutput as opposed to paint (). Taking
    screenshots in paint () was probably correct pre-GLES, but isn't
    really correct now - we want to be able to read off of the currently
    bound scratch framebuffer where we last painted the frame. Reading
    off the frontbuffer is an imprecise operation because the contents
    of both buffers are really undefined after a swap. In the case where
    we are not painting to a scratch framebuffer object, we'll just end
    up reading from the backbuffer anyways, which would be correct to do
    mid-frame. Also added the new static const GLenums
    DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING and READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING to opengl.h.
    (LP: #771875). (LP: #771875)
  * shift.h: Minor indentation fixes (mostly replaced tabs with spaces).
  * Show Desktop .xml cleanup: Improved plugin description. Renamed
    "Misc. Options" tab to "General" Improved tooltips.
  * Stack Window Switcher (stackswitch): Declaration and assignment of
    local variables in one line. Merged if condition checks. Use prefix
    de- and increments. Removed redundant brackets. Fixed indentation.
    Note: stackswitch is still excluded from compilation, because it has
    not been ported to the new GLES-compatible modern post-r3320 Compiz
    codebase yet, so this cannot really be tested at the moment (except
    in Compiz pre-r3320). Nevertheless this MP is needed to reduce the
    diff size for the GLES port of this plugin, which will follow soon.
  * Ring Switcher .xml cleanup: Better description of the "Ring
    Switcher". Uppercase for titles. More precise names for the tabs.
    Improved tooltip wording and descriptions. Changed the order of
    options in "General Options" tab: "Ring Windows" and "Overlay Icon"
    options are now on top. No settings have been changed.
  * *Shift Window Switcher, new features: Implemented new option to
    adjust the vertical offset of the text placement and fixed vertical
    placement calculation for top and bottom positions. The default
    offset is 50 pixels now. Removed hardcoded and redundant float
    border. Use 256x256 pixels resolution for icon textures, instead of
    96x96. Minor indentation fixes. (LP: #1173684). (LP: #1173684)
  * Opacity, Brightness and Saturation (obs) .xml cleanup: Better plugin
    description. Improved setting names and tooltips.
  * Opacity, Brightness and Saturation (obs) code cleanup: Replaced
    #define MODIFIER_COUNT 3 with const unsigned short MODIFIER_COUNT =
    3; (the variable MODIFIER_COUNT is needed in obs.h and obs.cpp). Use
    prefix instead of postfix increment. Merged if condition checks.
    Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line. Removed
    redundant brackets. Added and removed newlines if appropriate.
    Indentation fixes.
  * Improved and optimized ABI logic checks consistently for all
    plugins. (LP: #1178228). (LP: #1178228)
  * *Grid, code changes and fixes: Fixed segfault in Compiz when
    unchecking "Snap windows back to original size". This option now
    fully works and will snap back windows to current size, if they are
    dragged off via mouse. Fixed segfault in Compiz when unchecking
    "Snapoff Maximized/Semi-maximized Windows" - this option is now
    removed as this setting is configurable via "Move" plugin already.
    The snapoff threshold global setting is now configurable instead of
    hardcoded. Fixed broken cursor y-coordinate calculation. Fixed
    window placement cursor calculation for non-original-size-restored
    windows. Make sure grid-maximizing will never overwrite the windows'
    original size. Removed useless code until someone can convince me
    that we need it (LP: #1020857). This fixes the weird positioning
    (50, 50) when restoring mouse-grid-maximized windows via keyboard.
    Added missing ABI checks of OpenGL and Composite. *Grid, xml changes
    and fixes: Put Corners/Edges setting into own tab. New tab named
    "Resize Actions". Removed hardcoded SNAPOFF_THRESHOLD and made it
    configurable. Improved tooltips. Re-applied the quilt patch to the
    changed grid.xml.in. Changed the put_restore_key to
    "Ctrl+Super+Down" to fix restoring of grid-maximized windows for
    Ubuntu as well. (LP: #1172641) *Grid, minor code cleanup: Removed
    redundant (int) casts. Improved readability for the if condition
    checks. Added and removed newlines, if appropriate. Added comments.
    Indentation fixes. (LP: #745159, LP: #1020857, LP: #1172641). (LP:
    #1020857, #745159, #1172641)
  * Resize, minor code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. Added and removed newlines, if appropriate.
    Removed redundant brackets. Indentation fixes.
  * Wobbly Windows, code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. Merged if statements. Removed redundant
    brackets. Added missing break. Removed and added newlines for better
    readability. Fixed indentation.
  * Ring, Shift and Stack Window Switcher: Increased the non-power-of-2
    icon texture resolution from 96x96 to 512x512 pixels, in the case of
    the ring switcher from 64 to 512. Static Switcher: Replaced #define
    of MAX_ICON_SIZE with type-safe extern const unsigned short and set
    the icon resolution to 512 as well. Compiztoolbox: Increased the
    non-power-of-2 icon texture resolution const unsigned short
    ICON_SIZE from 48 to 512 and const unsigned int MAX_ICON_SIZE from
    256 to 512 as well. Changed the type of MAX_ICON_SIZE from const
    unsigned int to const unsigned short. Scale: Increased the non-
    power-of-2 icon texture resolution from 96x96 to 512x512 pixels. KDE
    Compatibility: Increased the icon texture resolution from 256x256 to
    512x512 pixels. (LP: #1173914). (LP: #1173914)
  * Removed redundant Expo configuration changes from ubuntu-
    config.patch: The reflection scale change, because reflection is
    disabled by default anyway. The inactive viewport saturation change
    from 100.0% to 40.0%, because this option does not work (and never
    did AFAICR), but if it finally gets fixed Expo's look would
    dramatically change. (LP: #1178965). (LP: #1178965)
  * Expo plugin: Fixed inactive viewports saturation setting being
    ignored. Let's "fade to grey"... :) (LP: #1179183). (LP: #1179183)
  * compizconfig/*, libdecoration/*: Use prefix instead of postfix de-
    and increments.
  * *Ring Switcher, new feature: Implemented "Vertical Offset" option
    with a default of 50 pixels. This allows the CCSM user to easily and
    exactly configure where the window title text should be displayed.
    Ring Switcher, cleanup: Simplified
    RingWindow::compareRingWindowDepth (...). Bail out of functions
    ASAP, do not initialize anything you do not need, if you exit
    anyway. Merged if condition checks. Declaration and assignment of
    local variables in one line. Removed redundant brackets. Added and
    removed newlines, if appropriate. Fixed indentation. (LP: #1173684).
    (LP: #1173684)
  * gtk/*, include/*, kde/*: Use prefix instead of postfix de- and
    increments.
  * Scale Addons code cleanup: Always bail out of functions ASAP, do not
    calculate unnecessary stuff before. Merged if-condition checks.
    Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line. Reduced
    the scope of some variables. Use pre- instead of postfix in- and
    decrements. Added and removed newlines where appropriate. Added
    brackets to foreach macro loops and removed them otherwise (if
    redundant). Fixed indentation. Note: This plugin has a huge chunk of
    code, which has been commented out. (apparantly/according to the
    comment, because it does not work) I was very cautious in
    refactoring this part of the code, as it currently is excluded from
    compilation and thus cannot be tested. TODO: Test, repair and
    integrate this code (or remove it if it is redundant). TODO: Fix
    half-broken "Exit Scale On Pull". TODO: Fix the scale-will-only-
    terminate-if-initiate_key-is-defined bug.
  * *EZoom (Enhanced Zoom Desktop) code cleanup: Optimized ABI check.
    Use prefix- instead of postfix-increment. Assignment and declaration
    of local variables in one line. Merged if statements. Removed
    redundant brackets. Fixed indentation. Added and removed newlines to
    improve readability. *EZoom (Enhanced Zoom Desktop) code changes:
    Replaced #define WIDTH (x2 - x1) with int width = x2 - x1; and
    #define HEIGHT (y2 - y1) with int height = y2 - y1; Replaced WIDTHOK
    and HEIGHTOK macros with local variables: WIDTHOK and HEIGHTOK just
    need to be calculated once and can then be used for all cases in
    void EZoomScreen::ensureVisibilityArea (...). static_cast <float>
    for int denominators in divisions. Removed these redundant gl calls:
    glEnable (GL_TEXTURE_2D); glDisable (GL_TEXTURE_2D); Zoom Box fixes:
    Enabled GL_BLEND for the zoom box to fix transparency issues. Made
    outline and fill color and transparency of the zoom box
    configurable. Outline width is 2.0 for the zoom box as well now.
    (same like for grid preview and screenshot selector outlines) Fixed
    zoom box damage handling. Minor restructuring in zoom box rendering
    code. Minor ezoom.xml.in cleanup and enhancements. Load after
    mousepoll. (fixes LP: #1171665, partially fixes LP: #1051290 and LP:
    #1051295). (LP: #1171665, #1051290, #1051295)
  * Wall: Fixed broken wall edge flipping functions: "Edge Flip Pointer"
    "Edge Flip Move" Removed void WallScreen::updateScreenEdgeRegions ()
    completely. This function not needed hereat all, no other plugin
    needs to re-define the screen edge regions by itself - just core
    should do that. The screen edge region updating also confused the
    edge flipping functionality. case ConfigureNotify: just breaks out
    now Added missing default: case and a break (just a style issue).
    Minor cleanup in bool WallScreen::initiateFlip (...). One
    declaration per line. Note: "Edge Flip DnD" still seems to be
    broken, but will be fixed in a follow-up proposal. (LP: #771448, LP:
    #858845). (LP: #771448, #858845)
  * Wallpaper .xml.in cleanup: Better plugin description. Improved
    option names. Better wording of tooltips. Removed redundant
    newlines. Wallpaper code cleanup: Use prefix instead of postfix
    increments. Declaration and assignment of variables in one line.
    Added some newlines to improve readability. Removed redundant
    brackets. Fixed indentation.
  * EZoom plugin, code improvements: Bail out of functions ASAP, do not
    calculate stuff you might not need. Replaced: if (zoom_level == 1.0f
    && zooms.at (out).newZoom == 1.0f) with: if (zoom_level == zooms.at
    (out).newZoom) because we always want to get out of here if the
    target level is the same as current zoom level, not only in the case
    both are 1.0f. EZoom plugin, code cleanup: Assignment and
    declaration of variables in one line, if possible. Added and removed
    some newlines. Merged if condition checks. Indentation fixes.
  * Mousepoll code cleanup: Removed the unused variables
    MP_OPTION_MOUSE_POLL_INTERVAL and MP_OPTION_NUM. Declaration and
    assignment of variables in one line. Added and removed newlines.
    Removed redundant brackets. Fixed indentation.
  * Annotate plugin, code cleanup: Use prefix instead of postfix
    increment. Declaration and assignment of local variables in one
    line. Removed redundant brackets. Added and removed newlines if
    appropriate. Fixed indentation. Annotate plugin, fixes: Use
    GL_LINE_LOOP to draw the rectangle outline as glRecti is not
    supported on GLES. Simplified the coordinate calculation as the
    offset is not really needed here.
  * Titleinfo, minor code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. Removed redundant brackets. Added and removed
    newlines. Fixed indentation.
  * Text plugin code cleanup: Do not declare variables you do not need
    if you return anyway. Use prefix instead of postfix increments.
    Merged if condition checks. Declaration and assignment of variables
    in one line. Added and removed newlines. Removed redundant brackets.
    Fixed indentation.
  * ccp code cleanup: Declare variables if you need them, do not declare
    them if you return. Declare CCSSettingValue *val; outside the
    foreach loop. Use prefix instead of postfix increments. Merged if
    condition checks. Declaration and assignment of variables in one
    line. Removed redundant brackets. Added and removed newlines. Fixed
    indentation.
  * Commands, minor code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of
    variables in one line. Return ASAP. Added and removed newlines.
    Fixed indentation.
  * Cube code cleanup: Replaced 0xffff with GLfloat MaxUShortFloat =
    static_cast <GLfloat> (std::numeric_limits <unsigned short>::max
    ());. Use prefix instead of postfix de- and increments. Declaration
    and assignment of variables in one line. Declare variables shortly
    before you need them. Merged if condition checks. Added missing
    breaks (just a style issue). Added and removed brackets. Added and
    removed newlines. Fixed indentation.
  * action.cpp and actions.cpp code cleanup: Use pre- instead of postfix
    increment. Declaration and assignment of variables in one line.
    Merged if condition checks. Removed redundant brackets. Added and
    removed newlines. Fixed indentation.
  * Rotate Cube code cleanup: Simplified a few calculations of this
    type: (360.0 / (x * 2.0)) == 180 / x Declaration and assignment of
    variables in one line. Use pre- instead of postfix de- and
    increments. Merged if condition checks. Added and removed newlines
    and brackets. Fixed indentation. Added TODO comments.
  * Fade plugin, minor code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. Merged if condition checks. Use pre- instead
    of postfix de- and increments. Removed redundant brackets. Added and
    removed newlines. Fixed indentation.
  * Opacify code cleanup: Declaration of local variables outside of
    loops. Calculate activeOpacity and targetOpacity just once, not for
    each window. Use prefix instead of postfix increments. Merged if
    condition checks. Declaration and assignment of local variables in
    one line. Added and removed newlines. Removed redundant brackets.
    Fixed indentation. Opacify, functionality fix: Improved the toggling
    logic by setting isToggle in the constructor according to the
    startup setting, then calling setFunctions (isToggle);,which then
    calls screen->handleEventSetEnabled (os, os->isToggle); to fix
    Opacify ignoring the "Toggle Opacify on by default" setting. (LP:
    #787814). (LP: #787814)
  * Widget, minor code cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. Merged if condition checks. Added and removed
    newlines. Added default case to switch (just a style issue). Removed
    redundant brackets. Fixed indentation.
  * window.cpp code cleanup: Declare variables outside of loops. Reduced
    the scope of variables. Do not assign values to variables if those
    values are not used. Always bail out of functions ASAP, do not
    calculate stuff you might not need. Use pre- instead of postfix de-
    and increments. Declaration and assignment of variables in one line.
    Merged if condition checks. Added and removed brackets. Added and
    removed newlines. Fixed indentation. Added TODOs (removal of magic
    numbers).
  * Fix for cube.cpp, regression r3720 - Inner sides of cube invisible
    now. Wrong variable type was accidentially used, cullInv is of type
    int, not bool. (LP: #1183852). (LP: #1184852, #1183852)
  * src/output*.cpp cleanup: Return ASAP, do not calculate stuff you do
    not need. Declaration and assignment of variables in one line.
    Declare local variables outside of loops. Use prefix instead of
    postfix increment. Added and removed newlines. Fixed indentation.
  * Expo, code cleanup: Declaration of local variables outside of loops.
    Use prefix instead of postfix increments. Declaration and assignment
    of local variables in one line, if possible. Reduced the scope of
    some variables. Removed redundant brackets. Used static_cast <>
    (type) instead of (type) cast. Added and removed newlines if
    appropriate. Fixed indentation. Added TODOs. Expo, speed
    improvements: Do not calculate screen->vpSize ().width () and
    screen->vpSize ().height () multiple times, instead save them in the
    unsigned ints vpCountHorz and vpCountVert and use those variables
    instead. Speed up the curve calculations by using additional
    variables to save results to not have to re-calculate those all the
    time. The new variables introduced are degToRad, screenWidth,
    screenWidthSquared, curveDistSquaredPlusQuarter,
    pOne2MinusCurveDist, v0Squared and v2Squared. Also introduced const
    float halfGapX = gapX / 2.0 and used this variable in the
    calculations of curveDistance and curveRadius. Simplified
    calculations of this type: (M_PI / 180.0f) * curveAngle / 2.0, which
    is equal to: (M_PI / 360.0f) * curveAngle Do not call
    optionGetGroundSize (); twice, instead save the value in the float
    groundSize and use that variable in the following calculations.
    Removed the creation of the redundant bool hide, which is just used
    once in an if-condition check. It does not help to have this bool.
    Try to avoid redundant GL_BLEND state changes, they are expensive -
    only enable GL_BLEND if it is disabled and just disable it, if it
    was disabled before, otherwise do nothing. Try to avoid redundant GL
    filter changes - just query the filter state if the mipmap option in
    CCSM is enabled. Also just set back the filter to the previous state
    if we actually changed it, otherwise do nothing. -5.5f * 2 = -11.0f.
    No need to calculate M_PI / 180.0f 720 times: Calculate this value
    once instead and save it in the const float mpi, use mpi in the
    following looped calculations. Use const int scw in the same loop
    instead of calling screen->width () 360 times. glow.cpp: Massively
    increased calculation speed of the glow texture: No need for any
    macros here -> removed them and replaced them with local variables.
    Precalculate values, store them in local variables and use those in
    the following calculations (new variables are the ints winRealX,
    winRealY, winRealWidth, winRealHeight, halfWinRealWidth,
    halfWinRealHeight, xPlusHalfWidth, yPlusHalfHeight, xPlusGlowOff,
    yPlusGlowOff, xMinusGlowOff, yMinusGlowOff and the float glowPart).
    Used w->geometry ().widthIncBorders () and w->geometry
    ().heightIncBorders () to determine winRealWidth and winRealHeight.
    Expo, fixes: Do not force "One wall per output" on the user, if his
    displays use different resolutions. "One big wall" makes a lot of
    sense for many multi-screen configs, where not all of the screens
    have exactly the same resolution, so if the user explicitely chooses
    this mode, Compiz should respect the user's choice. (LP: #1009592).
    (LP: #1009592)
  * Compiz, redundant and outdated files cleanup: Removed outdated NEWS
    files. Removed outdated AUTHORS and ChangeLog files. Removed
    plugins/freewins/COPYING - we do not need another copy of the GPL v2
    here. Removed another copy of the GPL v2 from plugins/workarounds.
    This will reduce package sizes, download time and bring some order
    to chaos.
  * Expo, .xml.in fixes: Better description of the plugin. Improved and
    fixed tooltips. Moved the "Curve Strength" option closer to
    "Deformation". Refreshed the quilt patch for Ubuntu: There is no
    need to set the default distance to 0.005 as this setting has no
    effect without deformation. Set default multi-screen mode to "One
    wall per output" for Ubuntu, because "One big wall" works now for
    all display configurations and could potentially change the
    appearance for Ubuntu users. (LP: #1074487). (LP: #1074487)
  * Added contribute directory. Added QtCreatorConfig.xml, a
    configuration file for Qt Creator, which adjusts Qt Creator's C++
    indentation style to be the same that is used in the Compiz project
    (X11, mixed spaces and tabs).
  * Mousepoll: Fixed mousepoll version mismatch. (COMPIZ_MOUSEPOLL_ABI
    was missing) (LP: #1195659). (LP: #1195659)
  * Expo: Simplified the GL filter handling.
  * Fixed broken text in all plugins (missing COMPIZ_TEXT_ABI). (LP:
    #1196493). (LP: #1196493)
  * CCSM: Fixed vertical alignment of the text on the stylized keys.
    (Shift, Super, Ctrl, Alt) (LP: #1196345). (LP: #1196345)
  * Thumbnail, cleanup: Merged if condition checks. Declaration of
    variables when they are needed (C++ style). Removed redundant
    brackets. Removed useless "/* Could someone please explain how this
    works */" comment. Removed extern const unsigned short
    TEXT_DISTANCE, because this variable does not exist anymore (value
    is configurable already). Changed if (something > 0.0) to if
    (something), 10 times. Changed pointedWin = 0; to pointedWin =
    NULL;. Used centerX () and centerY () abstractions from
    compiz::window::Geometry to determine the icon center coordinates.
    Added and removed newlines, if appropriate. Fixed indentation.
    Thumbnail, code speedup: Return ASAP, do not calculate stuff you
    might not need. No need for WIN_W (w) and WIN_H (w) macros, removed
    those and replaced them with the local variables int winWidth, int
    winHeight, int dockWidth and int dockHeight. No need for WIN_X (w)
    and WIN_Y (w) macros, replaced those with int dockX and int dockY.
    Introduced int tHeight = thumb.height;, int tWidth = thumb.width;,
    int halfTWidth = tWidth / 2; and int halfTHeight = tHeight / 2; and
    used those variables in the following calculations. Use
    igMidPoint[0] and igMidPoint[1] as arguments in the screen-
    >outputDeviceForPoint (arg1, arg2) function, instead of re-
    calculating the arguments again. Thumbnail, GL speedup: Introduced
    GLfloat wxPlusWidth = wx + width;, GLfloat wyPlusHeight = wy +
    height;, GLfloat wxPlusWPlusOff = wxPlusWidth + off;, GLfloat
    wyPlusHPlusOff = wyPlusHeight + off;, GLfloat wxMinusOff = wx - off;
    and GLfloat wyMinusOff = wy - off; and used those coordinates in the
    vertexData arrays. No need to re- calculate those values multiple
    times. Just query optionGetShowDelay () once and use int showDelay
    later. We just enable blending if it is currently disabled and
    disable blending only, if it was disabled before.
  * src/session.cpp cleanup: Declaration and assignment of local
    variables in one line. (this *should* fix bug #1101405) Use pre-
    instead of postfix increments. Added and removed newlines. Added
    missing break (just a style issue). Fixed indentation. (LP:
    #1101405). (LP: #1101405)
  * Firepaint, code cleanup: Declare variables outside of loops.
    Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line. Use pre-
    instead of postfix increment. Removed redundant newlines. Removed
    redundant casts. (from (float) optionGetFireColor) Removed redundant
    brackets. Added missing break (style issue only). Added comment and
    TODO. Fixed indentation. Firepaint, speedup: We just enable GL_BLEND
    if it is disabled and we just disable GL_BLEND if it was disabled
    before. Introduced the GLfloats xMinusW, xPlusW, yMinusH and yPlusH
    to store calculated coordinates instead of recalculating them
    multiple times. Introduced float fireLife = optionGetFireLife ();,
    float fireWidth = optionGetFireSize ();, float fireHeight =
    fireWidth * 1.5f; and bool mystFire = optionGetFireMystical (); and
    used those variables inside the loop. Firepaint, .xml.in cleanup:
    Firepaint now has 2 tabs, 'General' and 'Particle Settings'. The
    name of this plugin is Firepaint, <short> should not contain the
    description. Better description of the plugin. Uppercase option
    titles. Punctuation for tooltips. Improved tooltips. Firepaint,
    fixes: Initialize all class member variables in the ParticleSystem::
    ParticleSystem () ctor (LP: #1101512, LP: #1101580). (LP: #1101512,
    #1101580)
  * img* plugins code cleanup: Always bail out of function ASAP, do not
    calculate stuff you might not need. Declare variables outside of
    loops so they won't be re-declared in each loop. Use prefix instead
    of postfix increments. Declaration and assignment of variables in
    one line. Merged if condition checks. Added and removed brackets.
    Added and removed newlines, if appropriate. Minor code structure
    improvements, declare variables when you need them, not much
    earlier. Fixed indentation.
  * Text, speed improvements: Introduced const float halfPi = PI / 2.0f;
    and const float triHalfPi = halfPi * 3; and used those to draw the
    rounded background. Introduced GLfloat xPlusWidth = x + width; and
    GLfloat yMinusHeight = y - height; and used those coordinates for
    the vertexData array. Text, cleanup: Declaration of local variables
    outside of loops. Fixed indentation.
  * cube.cpp, code cleanup: #include "privates.h", not <privates.h>.
    Merged if condition checks. Declaration of variables, where you need
    them to improve the code structure and readability. Use C++ standard
    bool for topDir, bottomDir, allCaps and mCapsPainted[output] (bool
    true/false instead Bool TRUE/FALSE). Initialize all of the class
    member variables in the constructor. Replaced if (priv->mSky.size ()
    > 0) with if (!priv->mSky.empty ()). Removed redundant brackets.
    Fixed indentation. Added TODO. cube.cpp, code speedup: Do not call
    optionGetInactiveOpacity () twice, instead save the value as float
    inactiveOpacity and use this variable in the following calculation.
    Introduced the variables float halfHsize = hsize / 2.0; and float
    tsSize = 360.0f / size; and used those in following calculations to
    not have to recalculate those values multiple times. Do not
    calculate M_PI / sides and 2 * M_PI / sides multiple times in loops,
    instead save those values in the GLfloats mps and tmps and use those
    values inside the loops. Use GLdouble mDist2 = 0.5 / mDistance; in
    the GLdouble clipPlane* arrays, instead of recalculating this value
    multiple times. Use GLfloat oneMinusFStepX = 1.0f - fStepX; and
    GLfloat oneMinusFStepY = 1.0f - fStepY; instead of calculating those
    values multiple times. Use float outputWidth = outputPtr->width ();
    and float outputHeight = outputPtr->height (); instead of calling
    the functions multiple times. Introduced the GLfloat normInvert =
    0.5f * invert; and used this variable instead of recalculating this
    value multiple times. Introduced the GLfloats mSkyWidth and
    mSkyHeight and used those in the following loops instead of calling
    mSkySize.width () and mSkySize.height () multiple times. Try to
    avoid redundant GL_BLEND state changes, because OpenGL will blindly
    change the global state, no matter what it currently is set to and
    that state change is expensive. So we query and save the actual
    blending state in the variable GLboolean glBlendEnabled =
    glIsEnabled (GL_BLEND); and just enable it if it isn't already and
    just disable it, if it was disabled before. (LP: #1101422, LP:

    calculations. Return ASAP, do not calculate possibly redundant
    stuff. Declaration and assignment of local variables in one line.

  * Satisfy matchers on getProperty as soon as they are set. The order
    of evaluation for matchers in Google Mock appears to be undefined -
    this means that we can't rely on the first argument being matched
    first and the second argument being matched afterwards. In turn,
    this means that any GValue may be passed to a GValueMatch which, by
    a design flaw, is unable to handle any values of a type it does not
    expect (at least not without an API change). It will silently pass
    the incorrect type to g_type_get_* which causes internal assertion
    failures. At the moment we're just interleaving the calls to
    getProperty and get_property - that way the expectations are
    satisfied and go away as soon as they're set. This in turn means
    that Google Mock only has to traverse one matcher rather than
    multiple matchers. (LP: #1187468). (LP: #1187468)

  * Don't timeout after 3000ms when asking compiz for a startup message.
    It can sometimes take longer in the valgrind case. Also timeouts are

  * Rewrite screen size change tests. 1. Rename the overly-terse
    variables names to variables names that have some significance 2.
    Split the giant three-test structure into multiple tests each with
    only one assert 3. Remove a lot of redundant calculation 4. Remove
    magic numbers peppered throughout the code. Use constants and
    express asserts as relationships between those constants. 5.
    Refactor some of the more common test-advancement code (such as
    changing the screen size) into the test fixture as common methods.
    (LP: #1167983). (LP: #1167983)
  * Refactor screenshot code to make it clearer and also to allow us to
    take screenshots in glPaintOutput as opposed to paint (). Taking
    screenshots in paint () was probably correct pre-GLES, but isn't
    really correct now - we want to be able to read off of the currently
    bound scratch framebuffer where we last painted the frame. Reading
    off the frontbuffer is an imprecise operation because the contents
    of both buffers are really undefined after a swap. In the case where
    we are not painting to a scratch framebuffer object, we'll just end
    up reading from the backbuffer anyways, which would be correct to do
    mid-frame. Also added the new static const GLenums
    DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING and READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING to opengl.h.
    (LP: #771875). (LP: #771875)
  * Set libcompizconfig_libdir before the modules get a chance to see
    it. (LP: #1173799). (LP: #1173799)
  * Try to launch tests on another server if there's tests running in
    parallel. Provide our own compiz_xorg_gtest_main and subclass
    xorg::testing::Environment to try and launch tests on another
    display if there's tests running on one already. This isn't by any
    means perfect - there are still race conditions surrounding
    XOpenDisplay and parallel test runs but it makes a more smaller time
    gap for conditions such as:  1. Client has a server grab on the
    display we're checking     and won't let go.  2. Two servers get
    launched on one port and one set of tests     interfere with the
    other. It also means that we're now unable to configure the display
    port, log file and config file on the command line. But we weren't
    using that anyways. Finally, the logs now point to
    /tmp/Compiz.Xorg.GTest.displaynum.log (LP: #1178514). (LP: #1178514)
  * Fix some files not installing: 1. gsettings schemas never get added
    to the install_manifest list because we use install (CODE) so we
    need to add a custom uninstall target for those, and also need to
    recompile on uninstall too 2. Run the gtk-update-icon-cache stage
    during install for ccsm and also add icon-theme.cache to the
    uninstall target (LP: #1168475). (LP: #1168475)
  * Wall: Fixed broken wall edge flipping functions: "Edge Flip Pointer"
    "Edge Flip Move" Removed void WallScreen::updateScreenEdgeRegions ()
    completely. This function not needed hereat all, no other plugin
    needs to re-define the screen edge regions by itself - just core
    should do that. The screen edge region updating also confused the
    edge flipping functionality. case ConfigureNotify: just breaks out
    now Added missing default: case and a break (just a style issue).
    Minor cleanup in bool WallScreen::initiateFlip (...). One
    declaration per line. Note: "Edge Flip DnD" still seems to be
    broken, but will be fixed in a follow-up proposal. (LP: #771448, LP:
    #858845). (LP: #771448, #858845)
  * Add a small compiz_autopilot_acceptance_tests binary based on gtest.
    This will find autopilot and run a predefined list of tests, wrapped
    up in the familiar google test format. The predefined list is
    basically a bunch of tests which effectively interact with the
    window manager. (LP: #1170013). (LP: #1170013)
  * Change the behaviour of undecorating windows. Previously when a
    window was undecorated, we would shift it back to an appropriate
    position according to its gravity member. That behaviour was
    problematic because in the StaticGravity case the window has to just
    stay in the same place. But then if you had a window with
    StaticGravity which then did get a decoration and later removed it,
    it would be placed as though it was decorated and appear to be in
    the wrong place. The correct behaviour is to place all windows as
    though they have decorations, and then when decorations are removed,
    to move the window back to the corner as indicated in its gravity
    and then expand its size to cover the obscured regions no longer
    hidden because the decorations went away. (LP: #1165343). (LP:
    #1165343)
  * Added some new hooks to PluginClassHandler to allow a VTable to
    specify if loaded. PluginClassHandler::get () was designed to simply
    instantiate an instance of that class for the core structure, but it
    did this without checking if the plugin was loaded. Added some new
    methods to PluginClassHandler exposed by LoadedPluginClassBridge and
    only accessible by those who implement PluginKey to specify globally
    whether or not a plugin is actually loaded, so that
    PluginClassHandler can return accordingly. Integration and unit
    tests added as appropriate (LP: #1169620) (LP: #1101026). (LP:
    #1101026, #1169620)
  * Satisfy matchers on getProperty as soon as they are set. The order

  * Revert revision 3278.
  * Immediately update the window matrices and regions if the number of
    textures changed. (LP: #1189369). (LP: #1189369)
  * Provide a basic decor plugin acceptance test suite. This change
    provides a simple acceptance test suite for the decor plugin. It
    creates a fake window decorator (cdt::FakeDecorator) and allows
    users to create fake decorations (eg cdt::FakePixmapDecoration)
    which can be serialized as decoration properties and set on windows
    under xorg-gtest. It also launches compiz with the opengl, composite
    and decor plugins loaded and runs some basic tests. Among them:
    BaseDecorAcceptance. Startup: Basic canary "can we start compiz with
    these plugins" test
    FakeDecoratorSessionOwnerNameSetOnSelectionOwner: Create a fake
    decorator, ensure that libdecoration sets our session name "fake" on
    the selection owner FakeDecoratorReceiveClientMessage: Create fake
    decorator, ensure that libdecoration posts a client message to the
    root window announcing that the new decorator exists.
    DecorationSupportsWindowType: Create a fake decorator, announce
    support for the WINDOW type decorations and ensure that the correct
    atom is set on the session owner window.
    DecorationSupportsPixmapType: Create a fake decorator, announce
    support for the PIXMAP type decorations and ensure that the correct
    atom is set on the session owner window.
    DecorFakeDecoratorAcceptance. WindowDefaultFallbackNoExtents: By
    default, newly created windows should recieve a fallback decoration
    but they should not have any frame extents.
    DecorWithPixmapDefaultsAcceptance. These tests create a default
    pixmap decoration to use in the hypothetical situation that the
    window decorator hasn't yet generated a decoration for this window.
    FallbackRecieveInputFrameNotify: Verify that we get a
    _COMPIZ_WINDOW_DECOR_INPUT_FRAME property set on the client when it
    is created and mapped (eg, an input frame window was annonuced to be
    created) FallbackHasInputFrameInParent: Verify that a second window
    exists in the frame window after this message was recieved.
    FallbackNormalWindowExtentOnDecoration: Verify that
    _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS is set to the default window extents for the
    default decoration when the window was mapped.
    FallbackNormalWindowInputOnFrame: Verify that the input window
    matches the extents set. PixmapDecoratedWindowAcceptance. These
    tests create a new window and an associated unique decoration for
    that window. MaximizeBorderExtentsOnMaximize: Maximize the window
    and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeBorderExtentsOnVertMaximize: Vertically maximize the window
    and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeBorderExtentsOnHorzMaximize: Horizontally maximize the
    window and ensure that the correct border extents are used.
    MaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputSize: Maximie the window and ensure
    that the frame window exactly equals the output size.
    VertMaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputYHeight: Maximize the window and
    ensure that the frame window's Y and Height values are consistent
    with the output size. HorzMaximizeFrameWindowSizeEqOutputXWidth:
    Ditto horizontal maximization.
    DISABLED_VertMaximizeFrameWindowSizeSameXWidth: Maximize the window
    vertically and ensure that the frame window's border-relative X
    position and width does not change. This test is disabled, as the
    behavior in compiz is currently broken, (but it means that we can
    fix it later and enable the test).
    DISABLED_HorzMaximizeFrameWindowSizeSameYHeight Maximize the window
    horizontally and ensure that the frame window's border-relative Y
    position and height does not change. This test is disabled, as the
    behavior in compiz is currently broken, (but it means that we can
    fix it later and enable the test). (LP: #1188900). (LP: #1188900)
  * Only mark for no further instantiations once we've finished
    destructing the plugin (LP: #1193596). (LP: #1193596)
  * Add more acceptance tests for the decor plugin.
    PixmapDecoratedWindowAcceptance. UndecoratedWindowExpandToOrigSize
    Test that upon undecoration, the window has exactly the same
    geometry as it did before decoration.
    DISABLED_UndecorateStaticGravityWindow Tests that for windows with a
    static gravity, the window has exactly the same geometry as it did
    before decoration. Disabled, as core is currently not moving the
    window with the static gravity back to where it started.
    AdjustmentExtents/PixmapDecorationAdjustment.
    AdjustRestoredWindowBorderMovesClient/P Test that changing the
    border extents causes the client window's absolute geometry to
    change. DISABLED_AdjustRestoredWindowBorderShrinkClient/P Tests that
    changing the border extents causes the client window's absolute
    geometry to shrink by the amount of border. Disabled, as the current
    behavior is to expand the frame window as opposed to shrinking the
    client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinks/P Tests that as the border
    shrinks away, the client expands back to its original size.
    Disabled, as the current behavior is to expand the frame window as
    opposed to shrinking the client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinksWhilstMaximized/P Tests that
    even if the client is maximized, if the restored border shrinks away
    it demaximizes back to the same position while also accounting for
    any change in the restored window border size. Disabled, as the
    current behavior is to expand the frame window as opposed to
    shrinking the client (but this will be changed).
    DISABLED_ClientExpandsAsBorderShrinksWhilstUndecorated/P Tests that
    even when the client is not permitted to be decorated because the
    decoration hint was removed, when it is redecorated it will be moved
    to the correct position taking into account any changes in its
    border size. Disabled, as the current behavior is to expand the
    frame window as opposed to shrinking the client (but this will be
    changed). DISABLED_AdjustRestoredWindowInputNoMoveClient/P Tests
    that adjusting the input extents (as independent from the border
    extents) of the client does not cause the client to move. Disabled,
    as this behavior appears to be broken in core. Move the
    "GetImmediateParent" function into the compiz::testing namespace so
    that it can be used by other tests. (LP: #1188900)
  * Unrevert 3728, fix failing tests. Change the behaviour of
    undecorating windows. Previously when a window was undecorated, we
    would shift it back to an appropriate position according to its
    gravity member. That behaviour was problematic because in the
    StaticGravity case the window has to just stay in the same place.
    But then if you had a window with StaticGravity which then did get a
    decoration and later removed it, it would be placed as though it was
    decorated and appear to be in the wrong place. The correct behaviour
    is to place all windows as though they have decorations, and then
    when decorations are removed, to move the window back to the corner
    as indicated in its gravity and then expand its size to cover the
    obscured regions no longer hidden because the decorations went away.
    (LP: #1165343).   1. Completely remove decorOffsetMove and other
    related code from      decor.cpp. Put the logic to handle the
    window->input () - window->border ()      placement offset inside of
    setWindowFrameExtents instead. Now the window      will always be
    offset from its original non-decorated position to the new
         decorated position, rather than having to guess between
    decoration sizes.   2. Make saveGeometry and restoreGeometry work
    relative to window->border ()      as opposed to including it in the
    saved geometry. It is possible that the      border size might
    change during maximization, as such, we don't want to      save the
    position with the border before maximizing. Instead save the
    position      as if it were never decorated so that when the window
    is restored it can be      restored to its original position and
    then adjusted for its new border size.   3. Fix a few typoes in the
    tests.   4. Moved some commonly used matchers into compiz::testing
      5. Make COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR accept multiple directories and look in
    each one      of them for the plugin   6. Set COMPIZ_PLUGIN_DIR
    appropriately for each plugin that we wish to load      on startup
    so that we load locally built plugins as opposed to installed
         ones.   7. Uncomment compiz_discover_tests for the acceptance
    tests. Now they are      run by default. (LP: #1195522). (LP:
    #1195522, #1165343)
  * Add a simple script for making releases.
  * Port to new gmock. Disable some faling tests because of weird leaks.
    (LP: #1185265)
  * Don't add the frame to the toplevel stack if it hasn't been created
    yet. In the event that a window is unreparented or destroyed, we
    usually need to add its frame window to the toplevel window stack
    until the time at which we recieve a DestroyNotify for it, as there
    may be incoming ConfigureNotify events puporting to stack other
    windows relative to that frame. However, this does not apply in the
    case where we have not yet received a CreateNotify for the frame
    window. In that case, it is not possible for any stacking requests
    to be made relative to this window, so it does not need to be added
    immediately. Instead, we can add it at the time that we recieve a
    CreateNotify for it as a regular override redirect window until the
    time that it is later destroyed. (LP: #1171314). (LP: #1171314)
  * Remove redundant src/logmessage/include/core/logmessage.h (LP:
    #1067246). (LP: #1067246)
  * Adjust acceptance tests for the fix to LP: #1198000 1. Always set
    frame extents before updating the frame 2. Added
    COMPIZ_NO_CONFIGURE_BUFFER_LOCKS so that we don't have to deal with
    the delayed configure requests logic in the tests where it does not
    help 3. Split restoredDecorationSize in to
    restoredDecorationBorderSize and restoredDecorationInputSize so that
    we can measure the size of the decoration both in terms of its
    visible and invisible border 4. Wait for the default decoration
    properly 5. Capture the initial geometry of the window with and
    without decorations when the window gets its first decoration. Use
    these values to calculate the size changes in the window from then
    on instead of its creation values 6. Just flag when the window was
    first decorated in setWindowFrameExtents rather than checking if it
    is mapped. We only want to not resize the window once. (LP:

    - Avoid division by zero, if plugins try to deform a window down to size
      zero. (LP: #1045235)
    - Make "Unredirect Fullscreen Windows" more reliable. This fixes the
      problem with unredirection failing to engage at all (LP: #1041066) when
      gtk-window-decorator creates offscreen windows that are stacked on top.
      This also fixes the problem with unredirect hiding all windows,
      because it thinks the desktop window should be stacked on top
      (LP: #980663).

    - Fix show-hud, bump COMPIZ_GNOME_INTEGRATED_SETTINGS_LIST_SIZE.
      (LP: #1046212)
    - Fixed: Windows with an alpha-channel, like gnome-terminal, were not
      being considered as possibly covering fullscreen windows. But they most
      certainly can. This ensures such RGBA windows are visible if they're 
      stacked above a fullscreen window. (LP: #1046661)
    - Remove ListToStringList (LP: #1046184)
    - Fix typo causing CMake Error (LP: #1045665)

      (LP: #1046770)
    - Implements some cleanup that was suggested on the merge for the original
      port to gsettings. Other issues fixed as well. (LP: #1042323)
    - Fix the case where a new gsettings schema got added for building but
      it wasn't recompiled locally (LP: #1046701)
    - Scale: select the window under the pointer, when the scale animation 
      is over. (LP: #1045127)
    - Fixes the some "Use of uninitialised value" warnings reported by
      valgrind (LP: #1004336))
    - Check if org.gnome.mutter is available before using it (LP: #1048551)
    - We don't need to map our style windows, prevent them from cluttering 
      up the paint queue (LP: #1042552)

    - Ensure window decorations always get rendered after the window, not
      before. This is how it was in compiz 0.9.7, and is required in order 
      to resolve unity panel shadow (LP: #1050704)

      (LP: #955035)
    - Fixes (LP: #1018602) : An invalid read when using g_variant_iter_loop.
    - Don't allow unbinds of textures kept around for animations in any case, 
      not just resizing. (LP: #1016366)
    - Wait for the server to finish processing requests before doing a bind
      (LP: #1016367)
    - Using the next/previous bindings the wall plugin didn't calculate 
      correctly the next workspace when it reaches the begin or the end of a 
      row of workspaces, so it didn't jump to the next line. (LP: #904205).
    - Added the plug-in "Stack Window Switcher" converted from git to bzr 
      (including full history) to Compiz. (LP: #1012205)
    - Added the unsupported, but fully working plug-in "workspacenames"
    - Added the plug-in "Trip" (LP: #1012213)

      which would result in fatal error: BadWindow (invalid Window parameter).
      (LP: #1019337)
    - Fix crash LP: #1019337 properly this time.
    - Added .convert files (for gsettings-data-convert) and a migration python

    - Fix build failure due to invalid sed expression (LP: #1023738)
    - Generate the CTestFile.cmake using cmake itself (LP: #1024214)
    - Avoid random build failures "_intltool_update-NOTFOUND: not found"
      by verifying intltool-update exists. If not, then fail cmake more 
      cleanly with a nice error message telling the user how to install 
      it. (LP: #1023742)
    - Fixed CompTimerTestCallback.TimerOrder failure on slow 
      systems (like valgrind) (LP: #1021139)
    - Fix incorrect shell expansion, leading to invalid "sed" syntax 
      (LP: #1029383)
    - Install the cmake helper macros and check for them in 
      COMPIZ_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH (LP: #1024179)
    - Fixed: schemas were getting installed to ${DESTDIR} twice
    - Reduced combined filesizes of Compiz' .png resources from 2.2MB to 
      1.5MB by re compression of those with Trimage Image Compressor.

    - Adds a COVERAGE argument to compiz_discover_tests
    - Fixed various problems described in bug 1030473, optimizing 
      performance and style (LP: #1030473)
    - Fixed commands addon desription typo (LP: #1033085)
    - Reduced the scope of the variable 'icccm_version', removed a break 
      that can never be executed, added the variables 'frameType', 
      'frameState' and 'frameActions' to decor_quads_to_property in the 
      #else branch in KWD::Switcher::updateWindowProperties () as well and 
      simplified calc_button_size (decor_t *d) in cairo.c.. (LP: #1030473)
    - Always call terminate callbacks for key bindings. ATM we call just the 
      first callback. (LP: #960652)
    - Make valgrind shut up about some known "leaks" in python and glib.
      Fix some leaks in the tests in the process.
    - Implemented single click exit from expo screen. (LP: #1033531)
    - Restore the fix for avoiding re-entering the glib event loop and 
      crashing. (LP: #1036490)

    - Additional keys from metacity to convert to GSettings
    - Maximize vertically if pointer reaches top or bottom edges.
    - Explicitly depend on resize-options. (LP: #1039834)
    - Add some docstring warnings about using those classes directly.
    - Fix some memory management issues on the mock objects, namely:
      Make destructor functions virtual where appropriate, so that we can add 
      them to lists polymorphically. Support polymorphic ccs*Unref function.
      Also make some other necessary changes to libcompizconfig.
    - Detect if rsvg 2.36.2 is installed (LP: #1039843)
    - GSettings integration backend, created a testsuite for it. Refactors a 
      bunch of the backend code, adds appropriate testsuites and refactors 
      the integration code to make it more flexible. (LP: #1035261)

  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Fall back to a refresh rate that is more likely to look correct; 60Hz.
      (LP: #1009338)
    - Benchmark plugin should consume its key binding, and not pass the key to
      the underlying window. (LP: #1009320)
    - Avoid needless STL operations leading to expensive heap operations.
      (LP: #1006335)
    - Fix a typo that was causing (LP: #1002606)
      (widthIncBorders/heightIncBorders)
    - Check if the window is decorated before trying to change its event window
      states (which won't exist if not decorated) (LP: #1007754)
    - Use the XDamage extension more efficiently (the way it was designed to be
      used). This dramatically reduces CPU usage, reduces wakeups, and
      increases frame rates. It also solves at least one observed performance
      bug (LP: #1007299) and probably several more.
    - Avoid constructing and destructing lots of strings on every single event,
      which was wasting lots of CPU (LP: #1005569)
    - md LINGUAS doesn't exist, it's mnk (Mandinka in ISO 639-3)
    - Move grid plugin to google test and don't depend on the plugin for the
      test (LP: #1005009)
    - Don't read plugin.Initialized and test the value. (LP: #1004848)
    - libcompizconfig's install () commands were still using the old includedir
      and libdir variables rather than their libcompizconfig_* variants.
      (LP: #1005176)
    - Execute the cmake files separately to ensure that DESTDIR is respected.
      (LP: #1005177)
    - Don't set_target_properties on a target that might not exist
      (LP: #1005008)
    - Don't allow windows which we weren't even tracking as decoratable to
      become decorated if they try and change their hints. (LP: #963794)
    - Change the mouse pointer while dragging windows in expo. Just like the
      ubuntu branches do. (LP: #987647)
    - Fix uninitialized memory use (LP: #1004338)
    - Fix uninitialized variable (LP: #1004335)
    - Delay unbinding of pixmaps until then next rebind (LP: #729979)
      (LP: #1002602)
    - Don't drop plugins from the list to try and load before you've even tried
      to load them. Doing so makes missing plugins silently ignored instead of
      an error message (LP: #1002715). It also means valid plugins in more
      unusual, but real locations in LD_LIBRARY_PATH will never get loaded
      (LP: #1002721).
    - If running test cases under a real X server, we don't care if Xvfb is
      missing (LP: #994841)
    - Don't assume pkg_check_modules always sets _PREFIX (LP: #993608)
    - Don't clear selections in ~PrivateScreen because it causes a race between
      the existing and the new compiz instances, breaking --replace and
      non-replace behaviour. (LP: #988684) (LP: #989545)
    - Always paint with infiniteRegion as the clip region if the window is
      transformed and always use the supplied region if painting with offset or
      on transformed screen. (LP: #987639)
    - Add synchronization primitives to the decoration protocol so that there
      isn't a race where we bind a texture that's being freed. (LP: #454218) 
      (LP: #929989)
    - fix a crash in the first attempt at this (LP: #996901)
    - Reintroduce the fix for LP: #994841 which was accidentally reverted by
      revision 3133. (LP: #999019)
  * Cherry-pick some post-snapshot crasher fix:
    - rev for Crash in compiz::wall::movementWindowOnScreen (rev 3255)
      (LP: #1015151)
    - Don't set decoration contexts on undecorated windows, since that might be
      read later and code will assume the window is decorated when it isn't.
      (LP: #1015593). rev 3261
  * debian/control:
    - clean build-deps, removing some suggests and rewritting some descriptions

    - run gtk-window-decorator in debian/patches/ubuntu-config.patch by default
    - put some dev files in compiz-dev now
  * removing compizconfig-backend-gconf, making this package (as well as the
    new gsettings backend) part of compiz-gnome:
    - added to the .install files
    - added the C/R/P to compiz-gnome
    - added the transitional package
  * debian/patches/ccp_plugin.patch:
    - adapted to new upstream code and style
  * Misc:
    - remove a lot of compiz-fusion and compiz-wrapper references (deprecated,
      upgrade path not supported anymore) in debian/control

      hopefully workaround the issue that some people experience.

compiz (0.6.3~git20071222.061ff159-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (git snapshot) release.  Refreshed quilt patches.
  * Remove build-dependency on libfuse-dev, since we explicitly disable the
    fuse plugin and it causes FTBFS on non-linux arches.  It should also make
    backporting easier (closes: #451149, #455516).
  * compiz-manager-posixly-correct.patch: fix from Brian Carlson to get
    compiz-manager to run when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set (always pass
    options before arguments closes: #456628).
  * Remove libmetacity entry from shlibs override (closes: #455515) Thanks to
    Rober Millan for noticing this.
  * Remove outdated info in README.Debian for compiz-core (closes: #454340).
  * lintian:
    - Standards-Version to 3.7.3
    - libdecoration0-dev to section libdevel

compiz (0.6.3~git20071208.25941d14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Sean Finney]
  * New upstream (git snapshot) release.
  * Remove autofoo generated content and create/remove it as part of the
    standard build process instead.
  * Similarly, add Build-Deps on autoconf and similar stuff.
  * Remove the old/buggy compiz.wrapper script and now use Kristian Lyngstol's
    compiz-manager script as a drop-in replacement for it.  This should fix
    numerous problems with plugin settings and window decorators not behaving
    properly.  specifically, it closes: #449389, #390929, #400583, #440095.
    it also closes: #446901, #447345 closes: #393501, #445026.  
  * Update copyright file accordingly.

compiz (0.5.0.dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the now obsolete Source-Version in favour of binary:Version in
    debian/control.
  * Replace --strict-binding and --use-cow documentation by --loose-binding
    and --use-root-window respectively in the compiz.real manpage. Thanks
    Michael Gilbert. (Closes: 432920)
  * Rearrange and add missing command-line options in the compiz.real manpage.
  * compiz-gtk needs to conflict with libmetacity0 (<< 1:2.15.21) because of
    an incompatible ABI change. This should really be fixed in libmetacity. A
    shlibs bump should do the trick. (Closes: 425631)
  * Add upstream patch that fixes non-tfp textures (icons, cube top image
    etc.) on big endian platforms. Thanks Michel Dänzer.
  * Run dh_makeshlibs with -V. (Closes: 425463)
  * Use package-local shlibs override file to depend on libmetacity0 (>=
    1:2.15.21) and libdecoration0 (>= 0.5.0). Thanks Sune Vuorela.

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream development release:
    - Remove stencil buffer requirement.
    - Focus stealing prevention support.
    - Better occlusion detection and more efficient rendering.
    - Added plugins:
      + blur: blur windows and contents behind translucent windows
      + fuse: map compiz options to a file-system
      + ini: flat file configuration backend
      + inotify: file change notification
      + video: composited video interface for efficient playback
  * Forward-port patches:
    - Dropped 012_debian-kde-includes-dir.patch, no longer needed.
    - Dropped 013_set-qtdir-fallback.patch, no longer needed.
    - Refresh other patches.
  * Use compiz' default set of plugins.
  * Add build-dependency on libfuse-dev needed by the fuse plugin.
  * No longer conflict with metacity >= 2.15.21, now that metacity 2.18 is in
    unstable. (Closes: #411012)
  * Add symlink to the compiz-core README to the compiz package.
    (Closes: #408605)
  * Drop po/*.gmo and kde/window-decorator/*.moc.cpp from the original
    tarball. Add a note to debian/copyright.
  * Pass QTDIR=/usr to the configure script so that the moc can be found.
  * shlibs bump for libdecoration because it contains added symbols.
    Thanks Julien Cristau.

compiz (0.3.6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Thierry Reding ]
  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 002_tfp-server-extension.patch, obsolete.
    + Drop 005_glfinish.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Refresh 011_snap-by-default.patch.
  * Replace build-dependency on libdbus-1-dev by libdbus-glib-1-dev.
  * Add build-dependency on kdebase-dev and libdbus-qt-1-dev for the KDE
    window decorator.
  * Add patch 012_debian-kde-includes-dir to correctly detect the KDE include
    directory on Debian systems.
  * Add patch 013_set-qtdir-fallback to set the QTDIR variable to /usr if it
    has not explicitly been set before. This allows the configure script to
    correctly detect the moc compiler.
  * Add the compiz-kde package which provides a window decorator for KDE.
    Closes: #390338.
  * Add the libdecoration0 and libdecoration0-dev packages. libdecoration0 is
    needed by both Gtk and KDE window decorators while libdecoration0-dev can
    be used to write additional decorators.
  * Add patch 015_optional-fbo which adds a command-line option for disabling
    the use of FBOs (work around buggy drivers). Add the --no-fbo option to
    command-line in the compiz wrapper.
  * Remove the --strict-binding and --use-cow options from the command-line in
    the compiz wrapper. These are now the defaults.
  * Add png and svg to the list of default plugins. They are needed to load
    PNG and SVG images (e.g. for the cube's top face).
  * Check whether the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension is available in
    direct or indirect rendering contexts. If it is available only in indirect
    rendering contexts, force compiz to use indirect rendering.

compiz (0.3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    + Drop 012_metacity-theme-support.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Drop 013_fix-default-plugins.patch, fixed upstream.
    + Refresh all other patches.
  * Don't use xsfbs anymore until there's an easy way to keep it up-to-date
    in git repositories. For now using quilt works just fine.
  * Drop build-dependencies on automake1.9 and libtool because we don't run
    the complete autotools stack anymore.
  * Add missing dependencies to the compiz-dev package. It needs to pull in
    all packages required by its pkgconfig file.
  * Add a dependency on libgl1-mesa-dev | libgl-dev to compiz-dev because
    compiz.h includes files provided in that package.

    + Drop 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch, applied upstream.
  * Make 012_metacity-theme-support also patch the configure script, not only
    configure.ac.
  * Add 013_fix-default-plugins.patch which fixes upstream's handling of the
    default plugins configuration variable.
  * Make all plugins that were enabled in previous versions default plugins so
    compiz' behaviour doesn't change. Drop the 'water' plugin because our X
    server does not support it yet.
  * Drop --disable-kde from the configure flags because it is now disabled by
    default.
  * Add a dependency on mesa-utils to compiz-core to provide glxinfo that is
    needed by the compiz wrapper. Thanks Per Bojsen.
    Closes: #393113.
  * Conflict with libmetacity0 (>= 1:2.15.21) because it would currently make
    gtk-window-decorator segfault.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Add myself to uploaders. Thierry is still the primary maintainer.

    metacity library for theme support so that compiz can be built for Debian
    unstable.
  * Install a schemas file for the Gtk window decorator which is used to
    enable the use of metacity themes.
  * Suggest nvidia-glx (>= 1.0.9625-1). (Closes: #390326).
  * Add code to the compiz wrapper to handle the NVIDIA GLX implementation
    Closes: #390814.
  * No longer build static versions of the plugins.
  * Remove .la files manually because they are not needed.
  * Clean up build-dependencies:
    + Remove unnecessarily versioned build-dependencies.
    + Tighten the build-dependency on libxcomposite-dev to (>= 1:0.3-2).
      Closes: 390304, 390416.
  * Add a manpage documenting the compiz wrapper.
  * Check if the gconf plugin is installed before trying to load it in the
    wrapper.
  * Enable building the gconf-dump plugin.
  * Add a README file to the compiz-core package.
  * List copyright holders and contributors in the copyright file.
    Closes: #392422.
  * Add 013_dont-fail-if-theme-not-found.patch which will make compiz use its
    default theme if the metacity theme cannot be found.
  * Make compiz-gtk suggest gnome-themes so people can take advantage of the
    metacity theme support.

  [ David Nusinow ]
  * Tighten up all the X library build-depends by explicitly using current
    versions. Thanks aj.

  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * Move compiz.{docs,install,manpages} to compiz-core.{docs,install,manpages}

compiz (0.0.13+git20060928-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #352151)

    extension.
  * Add build-dependency on libmetacity-dev, which is needed for metacity
    theme support.
  * Add the compiz-gtk package containing the former gnome-window-decorator.
    The compiz-gnome package provides the files necessary to integrate compiz
    and compiz-gtk with the GNOME desktop environment.
  * Add a build-dependency on libxinerama-dev, needed to build compiz with
    support for the xinerama extension.
