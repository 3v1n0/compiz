1. About this document
======================
This is a working copy, and is in no way complete. It is meant to be used
while developing the actual functions. 

The idea is to use dbus to communicate events to the ezoom plugin. This API
will define the functions available through dbus and expected use cases.
External programs will be written to fetch events from at-spi for instance.

2. Basic functions
==================

2.1 ensure_visiblity 
--------------------
Arguments:
    int32: x
    int32: y
    int32: root

Ensures the point bound by x,y on the screen with the root window 'root' is
visible. Does not modify zoom level.

2.2 ensure_area_visiblity
--------------------
Arguments:
    int32: x
    int32: y
    int32: width
    int32: height
    int32: root
    bool: auto_scale

Same as ensure_visiblity, but for the area bound by the coordinates x
through x+width and y through y+width. If auto_scale is true, this will zoom
out if the area is too large for the current zoom level.

2.3 fit_to_window
-----------------
Arguments:
    int32: window
    int32: root
    bool: auto_scale

If window is 0 or non-existant, target the currently focused window if it is
present on the screen with the supplied root window. Otherwise, target the
supplied window. If auto_scale is true, the zoom level will be adjusted to
fit to the window.
